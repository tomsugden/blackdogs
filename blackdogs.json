  "title": "Beautiful Losers",
  "body": "The early 90's lo-fi explosion coincided with and was precipitated by the emergence of hundreds of small independent tape labels, many of which only existed long enough to release one compilation. It was during this heyday that Simon Joyner contributed some of his finest material to various intrinsically limited edition releases. Beautiful Losers: Singles and Compilation Tracks 1994-1999 collects all such compilation appearances and the few singles made during these years, including the perennial favorite \"One for the Catholic Girls\" and \"Burn Rubber\", recently covered by Bright Eyes.This was such a prolific period for Joyner that he usually contributed his best songs of the moment to whoever requested a track, instead of reserving them for his proper albums. You'll find here varying degrees of sound quality and various approaches to songs, from solo acoustic to full band, but what ties the collection together is the strength of the material. This isn't filler. The same themes that haunt his large scale work are explored here: death, love, the politics of time. Fans of Joyner's albums can now stop searching for the impossible to find cassettes and out of print 7\" records. Jagjaguwar have compiled everything here, even the songs Simon would rather forget. For those unfamiliar with Simon Joyner's music, this compilation is a good place to start as it serves in the same capacity as the original compilations and 7\" records, to introduce the ambivalent audience to the ambitious songwriter.== Tracklisting ==# ((Love Is Worth Suffering For))# ((Fearful Man))# ((Robin Hood))# Jeff Engel Rules# Don't Begrudge a Man His Funeral# Milk# Godzilla# ((Sorrow Floats))# Hotter Than Satan's Heels# Fluoride# ((Hold on to Your Breath))# ((Swing))# R is for Riot# Hot Tears# I Would Not Try to Break Ties with Me# Last Night I Had a Conversation with God# Burn Rubber# Veteran's Hospital Song# Flannery O'Conner# Judas Blues# Is This How Generous You Are?# ((One for the Catholic Girls))== Review ==For Simon Joyner's fans, this 21-track CD is the grail. It contains his singles, but more importantly compilation tracks from strange places, such as \"Fearful Man\" from the Circumstantial Evidence #2 cassette compilation - and that's only the beginning. Arranged aesthetically, not chronologically (though these tracks come from recordings done between 1994 and 1999), these cuts open up another door in Joyner's world. One utterly startling revelation that asserts itself immediately in cuts such as the aforementioned and \"Robin Hood\" is how much Joyner has listened to and sublimated the influence of the late Townes Van Zandt. For all his lack of self-promotion, Joyner comes out of a tradition of literary American primitives that reaches back decades. Another thing that one hears in spades in these willy-nilly cuts is how much time Bright Eyes - aka Conor Oberst - has spent listening to Joyner. (Check \"Hotter Than Satan's Heels\" and \"Is This How Generous You Are?\" for evidence.) The international nature of this compilation is remarkable. According to his liner notes, he sent many of these songs out without hope of them ever being used. \"Milk,\" from a double 7\" comp on Walt in 1996, is one of those chilling, reckless Joyner songs that gets inside the blood. One can hear, in the grain of his voice, a world coming undone in a vivid dream. A manic acoustic guitar strummed with panic gives Joyner the license to give voice to his terror: \"Put my life out like a candle/Smears two fingerprints/Saw a child crouched down/Write my name in fresh cement/She said I know you're in a hurry/But could you give an angel a minute/Well, I don't want to get up/While the moon's in place/And this bad dream's passing/Through the lines in my face....\" This song is indicative of the naked, shivering soul that comes out of the ether of Joyner's muse to testify on his records. These \"tired horses\" he refers to in his liners are the least thought-out, most immediate tracks he's ever recorded. They are loose, even raw. They feel tossed off, but the words are far too realized for that. And it's here that you can find yourself treated to a sound world unguarded. While his albums are full of emotion, they are also more studied - and ultimately very moving and beautiful. Where his full-lengths are conceived and executed - usually with other musicians (and some tracks contain other layers here) - according to whatever sonic path Joyner is following, these stopovers can't be bothered to follow a path, because they are paths unto themselves. This compilation is necessary not only because it reveals but because it confounds - it asks questions again and again. Joyner is as mercurial a songwriter and performer as one is likely to find. He's a true outsider; he not only won't come in from the cold, but he can't; he's gone too far by now. And the nebulous edge he walks, crawls, and stumbles upon is the blood-red stiletto of the human heart.''Thom Jurek (All Music Guide)''"

  "title": "Lost With The Lights On",
  "body": "http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/simonjoyner/img/sleeves/beau.jpg In over a decade of artistic exploration, Simon Joyner has never been content to make the same record twice. Lost With The Lights On is Simon Joyner's ninth full-length album, and it is a sprawling document in the grand tradition of the post-Dylan singer-songwriter epic. It begins with the narrator declaring \"I got sick in the rain on some holy day, dreaming of St. Teresa and I lost all your pills after they spilled out of the bottle into my possible futures\" and what follows are the promised vignette raptures, the possible futures from a creviced palm, where time and despair are corrosive but hope is never completely beaten, where dream and reality collide, standing in for each other on either side of a viscous world neither can complete alone. Some characters plummet unceremoniously, some rise. The human heart may be heading for an eclipse, the world is sometimes shooting for apocalypse, and Joyner takes us where we didn't want to go, to the darkest places, the deepest wells, where a glimmer of a light or a cast shadow can never be taken for granted.Joyner is a benevolent guide and he wants to see us succeed, so he's got to show us all the burned out basements and blown bridges and the traps along the way so we know how to survive them when they come for us, and they always come for us. By the end of the album, the narrator of \"Forgotten Blues\" can't see out his window, he can only see his reflection in it. The danger of putting yourself under the microscope is that you sometimes change the thing you attempt to study through the very act of trying to understand it, and Narcissus threatens. So Joyner changes his mind in the end, knowing he'll never make sense of it all, that you can be lost in the dark or lost with the lights on, and that's okay, that is life. The triumph then is in the attempt to locate a truth, in the expressed desire, in the challenged hope, in the struggle, and these are the qualities that distinguish these songs and this songwriter from the rest of the flock, the cardinal from the blackbirds.Simon Joyner was born in New Orleans and ended up some time later in Omaha, Nebraska where he has lived for the last two decades, writing and making music. He is an influential local hero with a devoted international following. Although he tours only occasionally and remains mysteriously private, he continues to charge the musical landscape each time he releases a new collection of songs. Lost With The Lights On is a dramatic addition to Joyner's diverse and uncompromising collection of songs and stories.== Tracklisting ==# Dreams of Saint Teresa# Evening Song To Sally# Happy Woman# Birds of Spring# Blue# Flying Dreams# Four Birds# Forgotten Blues== Review == To say Simon Joyner is a legend to me would be something of an understatement. This was the first songwriter that I felt really connected to. My dad always talked about how influential Bob Dylan had been for him, and I was often jealous because I felt that I didn't have a troubadour like that. Enter Simon Joyner. When I first heard his \"Iffy\" cassette upwards of 10 years ago, I was just awestruck. Here was a guy, only a few years older than me, making music that really mattered. He wasn't doing it for any kind of fortune or fame, but only for the love of the songs he was singing. I was moved to the point that I scrapped just about every music related project I was doing at the time and started over. I haven't been the same since.I once asked Simon Joyner what he thought the connection between home-recorded music and punk rock was. His answer has stuck with me. He insisted that the method in which something was put on tape didn't matter - recording at home didn't make someone \"mean\" it - but that what you put on that tape mattered more than anything. I was young and silly back then, thinking that somehow music that was studio produced was less sincere. I was retarded, basically. What this has to do with Simon Joyner is that about five years ago, he got a budget. On 1999's \"The Lousy Dance,\" he went into a studio and dropped the most impressive album of his career on an unsuspecting public.\"Lost With the Lights On\" is his latest gift. When Leonard Cohen officially stopped making folk records (see \"Ten New Songs\"), I was crushed. I understand now, though, why he did it. His soul was reincarnated inside Simon Joyner, and \"Lost With the Lights On\" is the greatest proof of that. There were inklings of it in his past two records, but on this one, the blindfold has been pulled from our eyes. Joyner's words have always hit hard, but never this hard. \"The bluebird said that love is dead / And everything else is sorrow,\" he croons on the final verse of the stunning \"Four Birds.\" He follows it up with an assurance, \"But the cardinal's song was / 'Easy child, let's wait until tomorrow.'\" It's a simple song with a lot of power. His lyrics have always had a personal side to them, but now his words have a more all-encompassing theme to them. Instead of relating his personal experiences, he finds a way to craft words that relate to everyone's experiences. His tales of love and loss are not just for him anymore; they are for all of us.Something I noticed on this album is that there seems to be a heavier blues influence on many tracks. Book-ending the album, tracks like \"Dreams of Saint Teresa\" and \"Forgotten Blues\" reek of the Mississippi delta. From the a capella opening of the former to Michael Krassner's hammered piano chords on the latter, there is sadness on most of this album; all of his albums sound like he's missing something or someone, and this is no exception. The difference is that there is more of a sense of urgency in these songs. It's like all the things you've been waiting to find out were just coming across the wire when the lines went down. Even though your gut is telling you that bad news is coming, you still need to hear it for yourself. \"Still the Senator's thug is sucking your thumb / trying to turn a black hat into a white one,\" says the accusation on \"Saint Teresa.\" Spin it all you want and try and convince yourself otherwise, but you know all the awful things are true, and you know it's your fault. I'd say this is brilliant, but that would short-change how good this album actually is.Joyner has completely mastered his own voice these days. I remember his early recordings being filled with cracks and creaks in his singing, and while they were endearing and didn't take anything away from the music, hearing him so under control is impressive. It's his deep, soothing tenor that brings the ghosts of Leonard Cohen to the forefront. This is most noticeable on the beautiful \"Birds of Spring.\" Backed by a wash of pedal steel and electric mandolin, Simon weaves lyrics that scold while remaining hopeful. One listen of Cohen's \"So Long, Marianne\" confirmed my beliefs. \"Blue\" is such a dead ringer for \"Take This Longing\" that it's scary. This is not to say that it's some kind of rip-off, because it's not at all. It's like Simon is seeing the world through Cohen's eyes and this is the outcome.Simon Joyner will be around as long as he wants, and based on his latest album, he's still got a lot to say. And while many people have a lot to say, few can say it with the poetic beauty that he does. The Cohen comparisons will likely haunt him for years to come, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Leonard Cohen is one of the great singer/songwriters of all-time - he was a poet with an angel's voice that could craft delicate, moving songs. That's pretty good company to be in and a comparison I'm sure he'll take well. And in case you're wondering, yes, Simon Joyner is as good a songwriter as Leonard Cohen.''Brad Rose for Foxy Digitalis''"

  "title": "Skeleton Blues",
  "body": "''Release date: November 21 2006 on Jagjaguwar Records''[[Sleeve simonjoyner SkeletonBlues]] For Simon Joyner's tenth proper album, he's joined by his working Omaha band, the Fallen Men. What they've created is a dark, rock-and-roll, beginning or ending of an era, seven leaf catalogue of people (skeletons) and their troubles (blues). Sounding like Doug Yule-era Velvet Underground, Dylan with the Band (or is it Neil Young and Crazy Horse?), and Sister Lovers damaged Big Star, this is unlike any other Simon Joyner record.The song cycle begins with a cobblestone street inviting a man in an open window to splash the bricks below, to the cadence of It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), and ends with a man walking down the street waiting for the rain to wash him clean. In between is all the news fit to sing. Joyner knows it takes a worried man to sing a worried song and the songs here are certainly worried, peopled by bruised lives, but make no mistake, this is not hopeless music.Unlike recent albums recorded in studios with professional musicians, Joyner expanded his Fallen Men and recorded live in a vacant old train station building in Omaha over the course of one lost weekend. Veteran collaborator Michael Krassner flew in to engineer and was forced to join the band on \"warehouse\" piano. Chris Deden (drummer from the early Sing, Eunuchs! records) returns, along with the protean Alex !McManus (The Bruces, Lambchop, Bright Eyes), this time cutting his teeth on pedal steel and sharing lead guitar duties with Dave Hawkins. Lonnie Methe is back too, playing organ and vibes instead of violin. Mike Tulis plays the bass.Skeleton Blues explores themes of loyalty, alienation, death, time, war and divorce. Like the doctor who warns his patient in the Passenger (from 1998's Yesterday, Tomorrow and In Between), \"go forth and run and hide but you're just like all the others I've seen, a skeleton inside,\" Joyner views our struggle for beauty and meaning to be more important than our fear of death and the unknown. His skeletons are people in states of transition, falling and climbing, failing sometimes but always swimming the backstroke from the rolling graveyards.Simon Joyner writes and makes music in Omaha, Nebraska. Although he tours only occasionally, he continues to charge the musical landscape each time he releases a fresh battery of songs.== Tracklisting ==# Open Window Blues# You Don't Know Me# Answer Night# Medicine Blues# The Only Living Boy In Omaha# Epilogue In D# My Side Of The Blues"

  "title": "Room Temperature",
  "body": "The old Russian idea that our souls are bound to the soil and we, parted from the land, are condemned to a spiritual dislocation strikes when I hear 'The Shortest Distance Between Two Points Is A Straight Line'. The immense prettiness of the picked melody combines with the chatty breeziness spoken between old friends loosely bound. Telling months of events in a few sentences as they know enough about each other's core that every other thing just acts as encrustation, dust robes paint, that change nothing of the essence. Songs about friendship are such hard things to do and it catches the mode so well it jumped immediately into contention for one of those end of year lists that will exclude it on a technicality.So much of what Simon Joyner does has the feel of the 1930's, of Guthrie and Steinbeck, the folk singer waif drifter seeing things through a jarred microscope, a character from a Hal Hartley film. So little is known of Simon Joyner that we can imagine him, untrammelled by facts, writing our dreams over endless, empty prairie like a Columbus or a Cortez. On some of the songs, the earlier, faster ones as Stardust Memories would put it, he sounds out of his time and it has been facetiously said makes the sort of records Bob Dylan would be making if he was alive today. He sounds so young, filled with vigour and idealism making coltish raw-boned music that bounds unguardedly forward, hopeful and unaware of its vulnerability. Us, we are children after Nixon, paranoia urbanity in looking for the meaning behind the meaning, disbelieving progress and chilled steel towards so much, seeing our antithesis an envy of sorts.The closest compatriot of this album feels like 'Another Side Of Bob Dylan' especially in the in the angry 'vegetables', 'folk song for Sara' and 'Leavenworth café blues' where harmonica and howling wheeze are employed to scorning, scathing effect. He takes the early sixties protest song and joins it with the wordplay of modern Americana. Taking the vocabulary of Wal-Marts and plastic wrapped vitamins he makes something more, something that understands surfaces as boundary conditions to the flux within. Still I prefer the gentle naturalness of 'pseudonym song', the north country blues household scenes tending to despair of 'grapefruit' and always 'The Shortest' that has taken out a lease on my affections.

The moon\\hovered like an empty room\\I could have spent a lifetime in.\\But even stronger was the cobblestone\\chorus, like a siren's moan\\crying \"give the street your skin, kid.\"But my smokestack eyes withholding rain, oppose\\another burning wheatfield full of crows.The magnifying glass is lost or misplaced,\\so take this portrait from outer space.\\See how the monument swallows the speck of dust\\while the weathervane powders the roof with rust,\\until the whole junkyard's riddled ruin\\and the story of the heart's communion\\is like the leaf of dew that tried to drink the typhoon?A bullet backed out of a gun\\a ray of light pierces the sun.\\Rewind the film and see the frightened run\\straight into the den of the crouching lion,\\holding hands and smiling. Once\\you're there you pray for lightning.\\Lazarus, you are free now to die again.And cassocks flowing from head to toe, conceal\\the bruises and the burns from where we kneel.A match scratching a wall devours\\the darkness for a moment and tires\\or so many past flickering futures\\and has the decency to disappear,\\while thieves and aimless gypsy bands\\keep and polish the queen's silver hands\\saying \"the life we cannot touch, we choose to feel.\"\"War is the horror Peace anesthetized,\"\\the oracle's iron lungs decried.\\\"The slings and stones we keep asleep inside.\"\\Meanwhile headless corpses take no sides,\\spastic banners carve up the skies,\\and the translator's gifted tongue decides\\just where the difference between two opposites lies.\\Is it in the pocket mirror where every tear is rehearsed\\or in the soaring bird's eye view of the scorched earth?I thought if I could curl into a ball and roll\\out of my skin I'd discover a soul\\instead of a scaffold around an impulse.\\I looked for a target but found a scarecrow\\which swallowed anything I fet it whole\\until I had nothing left but vestigal\\memories, redolent and rainsoaked.And that's when I finally reached the egg\\where I couldn't think or feel or beg\\to be reformed or reborn. Instead\\I pecked, lurched, cracked, clawed, and bled\\and emerged blind and raw to feed once more\\on a mystery unfulfilled\\where every answer waves within a sea of riddles.And the cicadas forever throb on the fringes of the lens\\while I dance upon this shifting pile of skeletons."

  "title": "Songs for the New Year",
  "body": "Simon Joyner knows every single one of us. It doesn't take long to realise this either - one line, one word maybe even. Joyner seems intimately familiar with every feeling that we all have but never discuss with anyone else - every doubt that stops us in our tracks - and he's stared each one of them in the eye. A few have backed down perhaps, but I think most of the rest of them just stare back without blinking. Most of these songs are about those. Recorded cleanly but sounding like he was sitting in a chair next to you, Songs for the New Year sounds sparse and barron but also rich with piano, lap steel, strings and accordian; a nice contrast between the somewhat deceptive desolate sound of Joyner's lyrics and music. A superficial listen to his words might suggest a deep sadness, and sure that's there, but repeated listens reveal a hopefulness and strength that really can't be expressed directly, and when you get to that point with this record you'll realize how great it is. Picking out a lyric or two would be impossible, but just the tale on the back cover is better than 90% of the singer/songwriter records clamouring for your attention today. Simon Joyner is important and this record should be displayed prominently near everyone's hi-i. Mike, for Popwatch.== Tracklisting ==# The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll# Oxygen# Parachute# New Year's Song# Two Friends take a Bow for the Record# When Will the Sun Rise Again?# Born of Longing# I Wrote a Song About the Oceans# Disappear From Here== Sleeve Notes ==Cleopatra sent for three baskets, two empty and one restless. Not knowing which was loaded she spun the wheel and lowered her arm into the darkness of the pregnant one. \"Goodbye, desert. Fare Thee well, Roman headhunters. Goodbye, so long.\" My grandmother used to day that there are two kinds of people in this world, those who think that nothing happens for a reason and those who know that everything does. All I'm sure of is that Time won't stand still for anything, or Nothing for that matter. So let narrow hands gather Paradise where they find it. You can drink your wormwood, Luke, and call it wine. That's just fine with me. Some will idle away while their acid tongues reduce the world to a hopeless, empty, purposeless thing. Some will gather in that rocking chair of lonliness. Others are meant for burning, brightly and shortly. But if eternity begins in vapour and ends in smoke, as I suspect, then all that business about forbidden fruit is rotten. Some laws are so unnatural they just have to be broken. That being said, strike me dead! You don't have to be Satchel Paige to figure out the world is hard and round and worth throwing.It's either too late or two early in the morning, the end of October. The cold winds from the north are raking the trees of their color. I hear whistles and then the silence of swooping or falling birds. My wooden fingers mangle all of my thoughts. I've forgotten what I meant to write. Aint that a shame? What was it someone said about the dignity of the movement of an iceberg? It's what you can't see that matters, or something, but anyway, nothing comes easy. A moment of grace is not stumbled upon or waited for or donated or found.

  "title": "Hotel Lives",
  "body": "The wallpaper is rippled from its age, sagging and pregnant with the water leaking in from above. The window panes are mildewed and cobwebbed, and a dozen insect corpses lie scattered on the sill. They are the victims of the naked bulb that hangs from the ceiling, casting a dull glow on the bed, which vibrates if you put enough quarters in the slot on the headboard. The scent of alcohol snakes through the room like a vine strangling a trellis. The bed's stained sheets cover a mattress that would just as soon swallow you as comfort you to sleep.This is Simon Joyner's hotel suite. It's not so much a place to live as a place to retreat to, a tattered sanctuary from the withering attacks of the heart on the cortex, and a place to retrieve your body from the floor where it fell in last night's drunken stupor in private. Joyner has lived here for a long time, first emerging from his tired bedsit in 1993 with the Room Temperature album, and following it up with a series of ramshackle folk records that have quietly established him as a lyricist with few equals.Hotel Lives finds Joyner opening up his box of demons and putting them to rest, one by one. His lyrics are those rare ones that could just as easily read as a book of spectacular poetry, but they're truly brought to life on the album by an impressive cast of collaborators. Not the least of these is producer Michael Krassner, who captures every expression of misery, pain, and redemption with a remarkably adept hand. Virtually every member of the legendary Boxhead Ensemble's new line-up is here; pianist Will Hendricks, drummer Glenn Kotche, and a host of other instrumentalists color cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm's sparse arrangements with painterly strokes.Though the music on Hotel Lives more often resembles the brooding intensity of early Leonard Cohen, it opens closer to \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\" with the carnivalesque swirl of its title track. The subtle electronics, droning cello and martial toms call to mind the work of Truckstop labelmates Pinetop Seven. \"Here's another song about an old hotel/ A place you can rise in, the same place you fell/ To get lost in solitude and saved by yourself/ And did I mention I'm alone as well\" begins Joyner, immediately setting the tone for all that follows.The rest of the album's 77 minutes are a lot less musically active, often stretching barebones arrangements over the course of six or seven minutes. And if Hotel Lives fails anywhere, it's in its overwhelming length. Still, despite its epic breadth, there are more than enough breathtakingly intimate moments to keep you from leaving, and further listens reveal infinite layers of subtle feedback, manipulation and countermelody. Lonberg-Holm's arrangements are subtle to the point that you barely notice the warm horns and strings of \"Now We Must Face Each Other,\" but it's hard to imagine the song without those elements.The song's subject never casts an eye back over his shoulder as he leaves the life of another in shambles. \"Why must you turn everything beautiful ugly/ And everything ugly so hideous?\" Joyner accuses at the beginning, backed only by a spare acoustic guitar. \"Will you ever tire of digesting the flesh/ Long enough to investigate the soul/ Or are you like the amnesiac goldfish/ Always surprised to find yourself in a bowl?\" he ends as the arrangement collapses into dust.Joyner's voice breaks all over the middle of the album, cracking with exhaustion and sorrow at every turn of phrase. This hotel is the same one that Jeff Tweedy wrote \"Someone Else's Song\" in, the one where Smog had his first conference with death, and the place where Tindersticks used to reside before they discovered 70's soul. Somewhere in the woods behind the parking lot, the Oldham brothers sit around a fire howling and strumming guitars deep into the night.The atmosphere of \"How I Regret That I've Done Wrong\" recalls the odd combination of junkyard ambience and traditionalism of Califone, while the loose rhythms and light strumming of \"My Life Is Sweet\" nudge along a vocal that sometimes resembles the tumbling delivery of vintage Bob Dylan. The song is perfectly placed to break up the brooding atmosphere, though the lyrics don't flinch in their wrenching account of alcoholism: \"I got on my hands and on my knees/ And I asked the floor for release/ I was so heavy it felt like I was being squeezed/ Through the cracks in the wood into the black underneath.\"\"You, David, Maria, & Me\" drags itself into bed on the back of a tired slide guitar worthy of David Roback or Rainer Ptacek, incorporating tape noise into the arrangement as well. The junkyard ambience of the second half of the album means that Hotel Lives actually gets better and fuller as it progresses, a technique that allows you to listen to the whole thing at once. Still, it's best digested in two forty-minute pieces, as spending too much time at once in Joyner's room can be somewhat taxing on the nerves.Time issues aside, though, once you've let Simon Joyner hold you in his poetic grip, you're likely to return for more very soon. And with collaborators like Lonberg-Holm, Guillermo Gregorio, and Krassner on hand, his careful documents of each stumble and insecurity of the transients in his world are fleshed to perfection. \"Listen all you lovers and would-be lovers to my tale/ The moral of my story is not hidden/ Though there are some lies along the way to disguise the details/ The broad strokes of this picture shall render its true meaning,\" he sings on the closer, \"Geraldine.\" When the song is over, you realize he's telling the truth. Joyner's hotel lives may not be ones you'd want to live, but when rendered so skillfully, they're easy to love.

  "title": "Heaven's Gate",
  "body": "In which Simon Joyner, in one huge, gorgeous gesture, singlehandedly takes American song into his hands and reshapes it into a previously unimaginable creature, a gorgeous thing that lives and breathes on the floor in front of your stereo speakers, and has eyes into which you can and will look for hours on end, seeing in them things you always wanted to see but never had the courage to look at directly.What does one say about an album that accomplishes the enviable feat of doing something entirely new? The voice plays off the guitar perfectly, and the violin soars like a crane, and Joyner's lyrics are not oblique (as they have been occasionally in the past) but dense, multilayered speech-acts, evocative and direct and - for lack of a term that might more succesfully tell you what I mean - well heeled. Songwriters who think they're tough are going to hate Joyner for this. Song writers who know they're tough are going to hate him even more. Between the aching sigh of \"Prometheus\" to the album's closer some 40-odd minutes later, we hear the sound of the ante being upped. Joyner's new songs seem to assert their own preeminence; that is they seem not so much made as dug up from the rich, dark earth.What this means, in the end, is that Heaven's Gate broadens the playing field. For this we should all be grateful, even though some of us (yes, I mean myself) are going to be bitterly jealous about it for some time to come.

  "body": "The most tragic thing in the world for singer/songwriters is, in the wake of sudden public acclaim, to take themselves too seriously. Sadly, neither Liz Phair nor Lou Barlow will ever get to record their Sister Lovers now; too many people are looking. Simon Joyner, positioned well below \"cult\" status for four LPs, still has that opportunity, and his fifth one, an ambitious double disc, just might be his archetypal \"happy accident.\" Partly because the album doesn't restrict itself to one motif but instead encompasses a wide range of styles (stark piano ballads, strummily upbeat folk numbers, country-tinged roots rock, waltzing baroque pop, dark harrowing blues), Joyner positions himself squarely in that rich (if crowded) genre known as hard-core Americana. His voice suggests a cross between Steve Wynn and Giant Sand's Howe Gelb, warm and unstylized, with an endearing crack that appears from time to time. Additionally, Joyner turns some astonishing phrases (don't worry, there's no space to start quoting lines out of context here), the kind that reveal the workings of someone who's spent a lot of time observing both what goes on around him and his inner life. He turns those visions into characters with real depth-even his metaphors seem to have background tales worth investigating-and he sings with the kind of off-hand confidence that indicates he understands his literary personas' motivations inside out. Arranged with care and economy and fleshed out with instrumental support from members of the Lambchop, Souled American, Vic Chesnutt and Edith Frost camps, these songs are as intimate and inviting as an uncorked bottle of red wine on a table next to a roaring fire in the middle of December. Intoxicating, too, the kind that keeps you eager to refill your glass over and over. At the risk of setting into motion some future tragedies, let me just say this man deserves your notice. Take Simon Joyner seriously.

More recently, Nebraska has become known as the home to Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes fame. But Nebraska is also the home of the singer-songwriter who Oberst has cited time and again as his major influence, John Peel favourite SIMON JOYNER.SIMON JOYNER digs deep in his treasure chest and unearths two new songs for us. Too good to be neglected, this unpolished gem should undoubtedly be a double AA side single. Both sides providing unexpected twists and turns with the signature pace only JOYNER orchestrates so well. \" Here Come The Balloons \" & \" They Say Man Cannot Fly \" are both moody & brittle with unconventional song structures and a subtle pop sensibility. Mysterious thumps and rattles and voices are woven into the background amidst electric guitars and the echo of percussion. On top of it all is the rarely triumphant but eternally hopeful sound of Joyner's voice announcing \"Here come the balloons inflated with words, they reach for the moon, they chase down the birds, and who am I to say they've just lost their way?\"SIMON JOYNER is a tantalisingly tender talent who has spent over a decade (and ten full-length albums) flying gracefully under commercial radar, where his art has continued to evolve, to the haunting effect displayed on this exclusive single.== Tracklisting ==# Here Come The Balloons# They Say Man Cannot Fly== Personnel ==Simon Joyner: acoustic guitar, percussion, voice\\Alex !McManus: acoustic guitar, electric guitar, percussion, voice\\Karen Gaitens: percussion, voice\\Chris Deden: organ\\Photography by Sean Dooley\\Artwork by Matt Dowan"

  "title": "The Lousy Dance",
  "body": "Call it hegemony, call it the Eisenhowerization of America, call it what you will; since the middle of this century, our society has been equating speed with success and thereby devaluing the notion of individual craftsmanship.It's sad, really, how depersonalized everything has become; we've replaced timber-frame cabins with subdivisions, stone walls with chain-link fences, handshakes with contracts sent through fascimile machines. And, somewhere in the post-Dylan-Cohen-Van Zandt era, we've replaced real songwriters with impostors-self-victimizing, cliché-collaging, manufactured personalities designed specifically for the suburban mall demographic and its split-level legions of well-heeled adolescents.Simon Joyner, poet, singer and songwriter, is quietly doing his damnedest to avoid this pervasive mediocrity that's seeping into contemporary culture; for the past decade, he's been earnestly crafting some of the most important, genuine and honest records in the American musical canon.He doesn't fake for a heartbeat or a chord change, and that, in itself, is a daunting achievement. Joyner is the rusticated brick in a world of vinyl siding: elemental, essential, proven.On his newest record, The Lousy Dance, Joyner continues to piece together songs that challenge both himself and his listeners. Lyrically, he's unlike anyone in the current musical scope, choosing to find a dialectic between the openly confessional and the ironically guarded. If the poetics of Robert Lowell and John Ashbery were given a chance to screw in the back seat of an idling sedan, these are the types of lines they would give birth to.Frankly, that kind of willingness to incorporate personal experience, to use the pronoun \"I,\" to be self-referential in a way that isn't cheaply humorous, is quite refreshing.Still, Joyner avoids the death trap of so many autobiographical songwriters: chronic lapses into contrived misery that come off trite in their own poetic inadequacy. The Lousy Dance refuses to fall back on tiresome surrealism or bland metaphor, two of the tricks most relied upon by the diary-slinging coffeehouse set. Rather, Joyner recreates his experiences and his emotional reactions to those experiences through the lens of language; he is as much storyteller as poet (although it could be argued that those two are inherently synonymous). Take these lines from the melancholy \"Fool's Gold on Main Street,\" a song that manages to convey an overwhelming sadness without becoming sentimental:\"What happened to Blake and Eric, Douglas, Phil and Amanda?/What happened to Jennifer the Great who loved me before anyone?/They're flying into the ground or walking high around my city/While my head is just some town you wouldn't want to visit/It's crowded and all the people look ghostly.\"While it's never a wise assumption to think that the narrator of a song is automatically the singer himself, Joyner's vocal delivery during \"Fool's Gold on Main Street\" is so blatantly passionate, so felt, that I've given myself the liberty. With these lyrics, he's completely reconceptualized the feeling of alienation and isolation and given us a new variation on a universal theme.While all poets do this on some level, Joyner succeeds in an even deeper way: he goes beyond pure presentation of emotion and looks to work his way through that emotion, to buckle down on self-confrontation, on truth. The stark juxtaposition of image, the ambivalence in the language, the metaphysical leaps from \"head\" to \"town\" to \"crowded\" to \"ghostly,\" all contribute to an overall mood that transcends the everyday. The poet's eternal condolence, that misery makes for good material, is carried one step further by Joyner: misery is a chance to re-imagine the world, to re-imagine life, to re-imagine personal predicament.Although I've spoken primarily of Joyner's lyrical mastery, this isn't to imply that he's traded in solid musicianship for inventive wordplay. Rather, the two compliment each other like foils in a Shakespearean drama. The Lousy Dance, filled with a cast of players that will have you cross-referencing your collection of avant-Chicago LPs (Pinetop Seven, Boxhead Ensemble, et al.) is a sonic feat as well as a literary one; strings, horns, subtle clarinets and percussive touches all serve to fully render Joyner's verbal sketches. Piano chords hang limply in the air, then fall away gracefully; a lone pedal steel note drips, honey-like, through a chorus; even a flugelhorn blankets a verse in a kind of hazy glow.Put simply, The Lousy Dance needs to be heard, and heard now. This is a record that defamiliarizes everything we once took for granted, grabs our mundane sense of perception by the lapels, slams it up against the geometrical grid of a back-alley brick wall and contorts it into positions that we never, in the furthest reaches of our dreams, would have thought possible. - Mike Centore, for The Miscellany News.== Tracklisting ==# The Lousy Dance# I Will Find You [[MP3 simonjoyner I_Will_Find_You]]# Fool's Gold on Main St.# Long Dark Night# It Will Never Be This Way Again# When She Drops Her Veil# The Rain Asked For A Holiday# John Train Blues== Personnel ==Jessica Billey: violin\\Jeb Bishop: trombone\\Chris Deden: percussion\\Joe Ferguson: engineering\\Ryan Hembrey: bass\\Will Hendricks: piano, accordian, vibes\\Simon Joyner: guitar, vocals\\Charles Kim: pedal steel\\Glenn Kotche: drums, percussion\\Michael Krassner: electric guitar, production, engineering\\Fred Lonberg-Holm: cello, string and horn arrangements\\Ernst Long: flugelhorn, trumpet\\Ken Vandermark: clarinet "

  "body": "''6. You've mentioned that although you had been recording since high school this was not for public consumption. Do you feel disconnected from the consumption of your music? If so, what made you want to seek an audience by putting out records?''I don't feel disconnected in a bad way. I think what I do, in the writing stage anyway, is a solitary process and it would suffer if it wasn't that way. By the time I get around to performing songs in front of people it's a different thing. I feel connected with the people at those times and the songs can bend and change in different live settings depending on what kind of crowd is there and how I'm feeling about myself and about them. I'm not really aware of the demographics of my audience though, if that's what you mean, and so I am somewhat disconnected in that way. I don't know who buys my records.''7. The 'John Peel Incident' where he played one of your albums right through one night and the backing he has given you probably drew your entire present European audience; Can you imagine what a full tour (obviously excluding the Netherlands*) would do?''* Wee Black Skelf are just sulking because the organisers of the Crossing Borders festival in the Netherlands insisted on a European exclusive, preventing any UK shows.''I've got nothing against the Netherlands. I'd love to go back and visit friends there. I actually had some of my best shows in the Netherlands. Yes, it would be fantastic to tour Europe again. It has been quite some time. I owe so much to John Peel. He played my records when I couldn't even get shows outside of coffee shops in college towns here in the states. But most of the shows I've done in England were sparsely attended affairs and it is so expensive to go there. I can't afford to have a mis-managed tour. I would really need some guarantee that it would work in order to do it. If you know anyone who wants to make it happen have them contact me.''8. Is there a particular Simon Joyner artistic work ethic? For example, is song writing an expression of some artistic compulsion that your day jobs allow you the wherewithal to express or do the latter provide an escape from what might sometimes be a duty?''I don't force myself to write. I write when I'm compelled to write. I write lyrics furiously for a spell and then I sit down with them and try to write music to go with it. Then I edit the words to match the music. Then I change the music to make room for more words, etc.....Making money through other means takes the pressure off of music-making which is how I like it. Luckily I find the time to write and I am compelled to do it often so that isn't a problem. I've mostly jumped around on labels that tolerate this. I absolutely couldn't make music if my records were being scheduled in six months before I wrote a single song for a new recording. When I have my songs together I make a plan with Michael Krassner and we book the studio time and we make the record. We do it when it feels right, when the songs are ready.''9. You have commented that \"If I had to live on my BMI royalty checks, I'd be writing different kinds of songs.\" Do you feel that indeed you have the pop acumen to write a Britney chart pulveriser?''You sound skeptical. Sure, I can write pop songs. But someone else will have to sing them. And someone else will have to record them. But I can write 'em. Speed up \"Insomnia\" slightly and have those \"intelligent\" geeks Weezer sing it and there you have it. It's much catchier than that \"holiday\" song they wrote that I heard in every store i went into when I was Christmas shopping last year. I might as well be making all that money. \"There Was A Time\" off the Motorcycle Accident could be given to Destiny's Child and it would be huge. It's really catchy. I don't know how they'd feel about singing \"the band passed by with blood in their eyes\" but we could change that line to \"the whole world watches while we glitter our crotches\" or something. I'm willing to capitulate.''10. Certain images you use, for example, 'the plains' and 'black earth' of 'Kerosene' are reminiscent of those frequently invoked in 19th century Russian literature; are there elements to the Nebraskan landscape or even a 'Nebraskan Soul' which are particularly resonant to your mode of song writing?''I like the open spaces of Nebraska. My family was from Alabama and Louisiana so I really like big open spaces of the South too. I love trains. I don't know if it is a conscious thing but I'm sure it effects me more than I know. I'm conscious of distance here. To me the great plains is a kind of unavoidable metaphor. I live in a city but it's a sprawling city and there is no real density in any one place so there is a lot of walking, a lot of travel. When you leave the city it's just you and the corn or you and the wheat for long stretches. There's something in that repetition of experience and in that travelling that finds its way into my music because I value those things, repetition and the struggle with distance and time.''11. You've said that your first wave of songs belonged to the 'Loudon Wainwright III school' of confessional song writing and that this directness caused more than a frisson or two amongst those implicated, yet songs like 'Ruby Slippers', obviously sung in the more liberating and covert third person seem at first to be rather rare. Bill Callahan commented recently that 'I only think there are a million people in me and none of them are in my songs'; how would you apply this comment to your work throughout your career?''Well I think Callahan is being sort of cagey because of people assuming everything he writes is autobiographical and I bet he gets that all the time. It's a typical exchange. The interviewer gets in the artist's personal business and the artist gets to remind the interviewer that it's art and not to read into it. It isn't fair to put him on the spot over something he cooked up out of some personal experience. Basically, it doesn't matter who is in his songs and whether they are variations of himself or not. He's obviously made something else out of them by the time they are in the song. Even a song like \"Sara\" by Bob Dylan, which is obviously supposed to be about his experiences with his estranged wife, just ends up being a lot of myth-making and tampering with the truth. It's actually brilliant sleight of hand because it is so hyper-aware of the listener's desire (no pun intended) to believe that the song has this direct referent and that everything he is saying must be true or he wouldn't have called the song \"Sara.\" So even Sara with a capital \"S\", the wife of Bob Dylan, is not in the song \"Sara\". It's some bizarro sara in the song and that bizarro sara is a different sara than the one in \"sad eyed lady of the lowlands\". Dylan constructed different myths around his wife at different times for different reasons. If you ask me, when you start hearing someone refer to a woman as an ancient goddess or some other idealized vision, you can be damn sure the one doing the describing has done something wrong to that person, probably in equal proportion to how far above human he has depicted the victim of his failures. If Blonde on Blonde is a description of Dylan's revolving adulteries with nameless blondes then \"sad eyed lady of the lowlands\" is definitely the great sweeping apology, and a beautiful one at that, but that woman isn't even human. I would argue that there really isn't even a woman in that song. It is just an elaborate cataloguing of everything Dylan saw lacking in himself. The song could just as well been called \"I'm a worthless piece of shit\". So, I guess what I'm saying is Callahan is right, technically, because it is impossible to depict with accuracy any of his assorted selves. But, he's sort of lying too because you can eat a bowl of soup and know what it tastes like even if you don't know what it's made of. But I'm being cagey myself because I haven't applied it to me at all. Pretty smart on my part. Maybe I think you should all just mind your own damn business."

  "body": "''12. If 'Dylan changed song writing forever for everyone', by, for example, showing that the transient (viz. the 'pop song') could become, in the traditional sense of the term, a legitimate art form, what techniques, forms and motifs in your work would you assess as being learnt from him?''I would say that Dylan didn't make the pop song an art form himself but that the degree to which he raised it was such that it was no longer a matter of debate anymore. I mean, Pastures of Plenty and This Land is Your Land are popular songs as well, and obviously Woody Guthrie was making high art even if he would have said he was just writing songs. He also said \"left wing, chicken wing, it's all the same to me,\" and we know he didn't mean that either. However, the point at which the songwriter unabashedly begins citing his arty literary influences is really with Dylan. Woody was well read and it's all over the songs but if he talked about writers influencing him he usually mentioned the socially conscience writers like Steinbeck and Sandburg and it was implied that his interest in them was in their socialist philosophy more than in their art. Songwriting was being used as a tool for social change and was therefore viewed as such. And Guthrie stood out in front of the pack as much as Dylan did in the next generation. No one really could touch him in terms of talent and influence. In fact, it really seemed to take a generation of songwriters to realize what Guthrie had to offer aside from the politics of his writing. It seems to me that an artist works within the context he belongs to and for Woody it was the Great Depression and its aftermath and the promise of socialism in America with all of the public works programs under Roosevelt. He was committed to these things but the fact that he had a conscience isn't the reason he put pen to paper, as some would have you believe, it's just that those themes occupied the thrust of his art a lot of the time. Now when Dylan came around all the young songwriters were writing and singing as if they had never heard Woody Guthrie. It was all very serious and very dry and they tended to choose for themselves either the voice of a black delta blues singer or the voice of some imagined Anglo-Saxon who would have sang all those English ballads collected by Francis James Child they were all gobbling up like fish and chips at Vassar and Syracuse and NYU. Groping around the 17th century for a voice wasn't advancing the art form. They were also thinking too much about their conscience and not enough about their writing and even when they cited Woody Guthrie as their biggest influence it really seemed like they just didn't get it. Woody Guthrie loved words at least as much as he loved down and outers and hobos and trains and women and guitars. That's what everyone was missing. Enter Dylan. He worked in the same context, a social movement, but he belonged to words. He loved words more than he loved anything else and Hard Rain and The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol are about words at least as much as they are about the atom bomb or the injustice of a prejudiced judicial system. You can just hear him drinking language in those songs. That's why they're so effective as tools for social change because as an audience you respond to the art at a gut level. That's what you want more of. You think you want more songs about social injustice and fighting the man, you don't. You think you want to sign up for Students for a Democratic Society but you don't. All anybody wants is more pleasure and that's what those songs are, pure pleasure. So, anyway, this isn't anything new I'm saying. Dylan just said it was okay to talk about Rimbaud and T.S. Eliot and change your name to Dylan Thomas while walking around in hobo clothes singing about the assassination of Medgar Evers. None of it was incongrous because it was really about art, not about anything else. And he refused to let it be discussed in any other terms even though the lure of a popular social movement and the chance to be its spokesman was dangled in front his nose. He rightly saw it for what it was, a creative noose, and he advanced the art form instead of collapsing within it. So Dylan's courage is really what did it, as much as his talent. He was courageous to link songwriting without shame to high art and to refuse to be put in a box by whatever he was doing. He didn't have a problem bringing the beat poetry he was reading to the Big Bill Broonzy folk blues form he was stealing. So you get songs like It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding. You get very traditional Child's Ballads-type melodies or folk-blues skeletons paired with symbolist poetry in Chimes of Freedom and Mr.Tambourine Man, etc. The songs were constantly evolving and he was freely influenced by whatever was at hand and valid and interesting. Nothing was off limits because he embraced songwriting as an art form and that means anything goes. The choice was you could be singing Long Black Veil and We Shall Be Released at 50 years old or you could be singing Visions of Johanna. Even as the skin hangs off Dylan's face, Visions of Johanna never gets old. It always applies. When Dylan stepped through that portal and didn't look back, everyone else was presented with the same choice. Die here as a footnote to a social movement or as an icon of a generation defined by and existing transfixed in time, or attempt to transcend and succeed or fail according to the merits of what you produce and nothing else. Did the angels wanna wear his red shoes? Yes they did. Yes we do. At least I thought we did.''13. Central elements to your work, for example, the use of 3/4 as a vehicle for story-telling, the lyrical usage of speech patterns and speech are also consistent with a 'folk tradition'. Is this a fair assessment? Is there a 'folk ethic' which other media cannot accommodate?''I dunno. You have emo bands today who riff on the Cure who riff on bands like the Stones and Jimi Hendrix. Did the Stones listen to the Anthology of American Folk Music or did they just buy Jimmy Reed records? Did the Cure go through English folk ballads while writing Three Imaginary Boys? Somebody down the line listened to those records. And even those musicians were influenced by someone they looked up to who we don't know about. And they and we don't know who influenced who but we know they were influenced. So there are massive influences which are irretrievable, difficult to pin-point, and yet unmistakable and no one is around to claim them because they arrived surreptitiously as in Little Richard via Paul McCartney or Michael Stipe via Curt Cobain. But be it the Cure or its recent progeny, the song is about telling some kind of story and how you tell that story depends on what you think needs to be emphasized. I like to use some traditional folk forms and some blues forms and time as vehicles, as you say, as jumping off points. For one, they appeal melodically to our collective unconscious, to a certain extent (my record sales notwithstanding), and hell, they're easy to learn and I'm no Alex McManus or Thurston Moore. My hands and the guitar are not one, so I'm glad to have them. To use these folk forms in non-progressive ways though is really uninteresting. I don't know if it is even still relevant to mention that someone uses folk influences in post-Dylan popular music. I mean everybody does to an extent whether they like it or not. The Dream Syndicate's first record sounds an awful lot like Highway 61 Revisited, revisited. It also sounds a little punk. But then again the Sex Pistols sound more like Chuck Berry than the Beatles ever did. They accentuated their lyrics and for that they were new or progressive even while the music sounds like the slightly accelerated first blurts of rock-n-roll, circa Eddie Cochran. The first Ramones record on the other hand actually sounds like the beginning of something new musically, and the lyrics seem secondary or intentionally non-progressive, non-emphasized. I think my use of the folk song has a lot to do with acknowledging that the music I'm most influenced by comes more directly from a lyric driven tradition even if it is via the Velvet Underground or someone decidedly not folk; it comes from a tradition that puts an emphasis on telling the story in a certain way and that way comes down to us through folk and blues music. I think having people talk the way people talk or having them do all the strange things we do is important if creating stories about real people is what you want to do, and the folk tradition and its use of conversational or natural speech and making poetry of that language is a good way to do that. I think this is what good writers do in fiction so it makes sense that it would be done in song as well.''14. 'To Almost No One', the title of your recent covers collection could almost be an epitaph! When, in songs like Petri-Dish you sing '.......is in love with Woody Guthrie and I'm in love with Woody's suffering\", you seem to be taking a jibe at 'Simon Joyner the singer-songwriter'. Is this true and are you wary of being typecast as a miserbalist?''Well, the songwriters who are featured in that collection are either under-appreciated as great songwriters or they were ignored by a larger audience. That title was a way of acknowledging that their art hasn't been completely forgotten or underappreciated and it's also a way of aligning myself with them. It also seemed funny to me to cover songs that almost no one bought the first time around, ostensibly so more people would hear these songs, fully aware that I have such a modest following myself that this release wouldn't really be changing anybody's status as either an underdog or loser of American song, depending on how you look at it. Covering David Blue wasn't going to gain me extra fans, and my interpretation of his great song wasn't going to actually reintroduce an ignorant public to the great records of David Blue. I did it for the sake of the song and because I want to forget I live in a world where truth is shit, and shit is gold.In that old song Petri Dish I think I'm talking mostly about a passion for life that comes through in a kind of suffering. Everyone suffers. To me it means struggle, not moping about or chronic depression. D. Boon said to tip your bartenders and your waitresses and so I do. I don't have a feeling that it helps out a lot but I do it because I appreciate that struggle, that commitment against resignation. I am also making fun of myself, it's true. My music is oftentimes mistaken for miserable. That's a definite mistake and it's too bad I'm not distinguished from a lot of music that does seem to be about celebrating apathy or misery. Telling the truth about difficulties or bringing characters to a point where they make difficult decisions and change or unfortunately, don't change, is all celebratory, I think. If something is so sad or terrifying that you can taste adrenalin in your mouth or hear your heart beating all of a sudden, you have just been reminded how much you love living. That's a good thing and definitely different from wallowing in or aspiring to feelings of depression or the like. Even if the best I can come up with is an intangible desire to live, received through the senses, and not easily explained; it's something. The best songs describe life, actual life at some level of experience. Death is part of it, sure. Loneliness, yes. Struggle, suffering, joy, etc. I think people don't want to feel intensely or don't want music to make them feel intensely. They gravitate to disposable depictions of actual human feelings. Spielberg instead of Cassavetes or whatever musical equivalent you've got. That's fine, but it's wrong to characterize my music as hopeless or bleak or dismal when that is the opposite of what I'm doing. I certainly don't romanticize disconnection or failure. Again, what is the emphasis? Is it a depiction of something miserable or is it a celebration of something miserable? There is a difference and I think it is pretty easy to tell when you are being asked to participate in an ode to misery and when you are simply observing a struggle, an attempt to change, ascend sometimes, fail others.''15. Phil Ochs hung himself after what he saw as a failed career, Jackson C. Frank died in obscurity, and Ann Briggs disappeared to the Scottish Western Isles; the lives of most of those you've covered would seem to provide material for epic country-folk songs themselves. Could we expect a 'Ballad of Townes van Zandt'?''Phil Ochs became very sick with alcohol and mental illness. It's true he was bitter about his career before he developed the split personality of John Train/Phil Ochs and began really abusing his body and his mind, but I don't think it's accurate to say he killed himself because he didn't get properly famous. He had a mental breakdown he didn't recover from and he wasn't himself, literally. He sold more records than Pavement and we don't consider their career as failed. Of course he wanted more than he got but I don't think that's why he committed suicide. As for Anne Briggs, what's wrong with disappearing to the Scottish Isles? I live in fucking Nebraska. You'll have to do better than disappearing to the Scottish Isles to make it into my sad country song! And honestly, I don't really have a problem with artists dying in obscurity. Most of them do. That's good, that's where they belong, Amen. When \"A Beautiful Mind\" wins best picture at the Academy Awards every year everyone goes around talking about the horrible injustice. That movie and all the movies like it deserve best picture because the industry that awards them isn't about art. What artist would want to be recognized by an industry that exists to shit on and strangle the artform he works within? The music industry is the same. It's not the 60s anymore. Major labels aren't putting out records like the Hampton Grease Band and the United States of America anymore. No one really concerned with growing and changing as an artist like Bob Dylan did, will be able to do that in this environment. So the only place to die is in obscurity if you ask me. That's the holy land. Townes Van Zandt wrote some of the best songs ever written and they are truly righteous and beautiful. The fact that Dylan wrote righteous and beautiful songs and got all the credit he was due doesn't really matter to the world in the end. The songs matter. Townes Van Zandt came from a rich oil family anyway. He didn't need money. All that matters is \"For the Sake of the Song\" is righteous and beautiful and so is \"Waiting Around to Die\" and \"Kathleen\" and \"Flying Shoes\" and many, many others and I think he had to know that, no matter how few seats he filled on any given night performing those songs. See, I am a romantic! Given the choice to be rich and famous or write a song as important as any number of Townes Van Zandt songs, it's no question at all what a real aspiring songwriter would hope to do in this short life. I don't think people are going to forget about Townes Van Zandt. He was very influential (Ryan Adams loves him) and I'm sure his records will remain in print.''16. Your more recent work seems much more at peace with itself; does the anger and disgust of songs like Hollywood where you rage against the beauty myth still exist?''I think the dark and insidious things we do to ourselves and each other are just as interesting and worth writing about as the bigger social issues you mention. I think the song \"Hollywood\" was pretty far along on my path towards exploring these issues, actually, whereas some of my very early songs rail a bit haphazardly at entities I have no control over or never really cared about anyway. There are a lot of places to direct anger and disgust and taking it to the source seems like the thing to do. At a basic level we all have to make some kind of choice to be victimized, maybe it's subtle and I'm not saying coercion isn't present, but there is a choice there, I think, and that's interesting to me. What makes us do what we do to ourselves? I'm not sure what you mean by my songwriting being more at peace with itself unless you mean musically as opposed to lyrically. I do feel more comfortable singing and more free musically, but I think I'm continuing to write about the same things I've always written about essentially, but actually going further than I did before. Sometimes wit or barbed-wire delivery merely cloaks or obfuscates a lack of investigation. I think my interest has always been the interpersonal and the occasional finger-pointing is the exception and even within the song, obviously not the real concern. My last record, Hotel Lives, was especially difficult to write because I tried to put so many different relationships under a microscope. I guess I'm less vitriolic but I wouldn't say I am less interested in digging into and investigating these things. Perhaps I'm just not hitting folks over the head with it like before when I was less sure of myself. Did I make the mistake of thinking it was safe to stop shouting?''17. Much of the sixties folk boom is attributed to the protest song but there is an absence of strong political themes in your work. Is this down to the relative tranquility of America?''No, I think there is plenty of political music being made so it isn't because of America's tranquility. I mean you've got political rap and hip-hop music, for example, telling it how it is from a perspective white America is learning to love. There are also a lot of feminist pop and punk bands railing on everything in sight, for good reason. You've got popular country music which is almost always pro-government and really conservative-leaning, and that's political, except for the Dixie Chicks who are total Leninists, obviously. The soapbox is crowded. Honestly, it's just not very interesting to me to write overtly political material. I can talk for hours with friends about politics but I almost never have a desire to write about it in song. Sometimes it works its way into a song and as long as it isn't the focus of the song, it's alright. I think a band like Gang of Four (and even Fugazi to a lesser extent) is mostly interesting on a musical level while their politics tend to be represented in a really over-simplified way which makes them sound like precious college Marxists. I don't want to end up like that. I think the way we live and the way we act is political enough and so having my characters acting how they act for the reasons they do and describing it all is political in and of itself. Now, if I were to draw conclusions about their behavior and tell you how you should feel about it and how you should feel about the government that produces people suffering in these ways I would be taking most of the fun away from you. God knows I don't want to be accused of taking the fun away any more than I already am. "

  "title": "Casino Souls Interview",
  "body": "Even though there's lots of new music around there's still a place for (lost) love songs, and the current favourite for me is Simon Joyner, here he speaks from the never too far away land of photos of you and old girlfriends and unopened love letters.''Who would you say have been your greatest influences?''My greatest influences probably wouldn't surprise you. I listen to a lot of music, it's hard to know what gets incorporated into my own. Some are subtle, some are obvious. Of the singer songwriter or folky types I'd list Townes Van Zardt, Loudon Wainwright, Guy Clark, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Randy Burns, Tim Buckley, The Velvets, Fred Neil, Leonard Cohen, Phil Ochs, The Bruces, Hank Williams, Ed Keuper, Butch Hancock,Gram Parsons, and a whole bunch of others Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, etc..... of course bands like The Minutemen, Giant Sand, The Dream Syndicate mean a lot too. Yo La Tengo, Sonic Youth, etc..... it's about 'the song' you know and I gravitate towards those who are concerned with the history of the song and with and around 'the song'.The Beatles, Beach Boys and Rolling Stones are big favourites, obviously.''How long have you been recording for now ?''I've been recording since high school, but not for public consumption. I think the first thing that I released came out in 1991.''Are you more popular in America than England ?''I'm not sure where I'm popular. I don't imagine that I'm popular anywhere in density. I think there are little handfuls scattered around all over the place.''Do you think American bands get a fair airing in Britain ?''You could probably answer that better than I could. I don't think English bands get as much air play as they should. I've been fortunate in that Mr. John Peel seems to like what I do enough to play my music on his program. I'm not aware of any other air play in the U.K.''What are you listening to at the moment ?''I'm listening to Townes Van Zardt and staying out of the sun which is deadly this week in America. Musicaly if that's what you meant, I'm waiting for an E.P to come out in August on the Secretly Canadian label called the 'Christine EP' and my full length L.P on Sing, Eunuchs! comes out at the end of September. It's called 'Yesterday, Tomorrow and In between.'''Which bands that are around now do you like ?''I like a lot. The High Llamas, Stereolab, Edith Frost, Vic Chesnutt, Lambchop, Refrigerator, Nothing Painted Blue, Giant Sand, Smog, Mountain Goats, Dr. Octagon, D.J Spooky, Yo La Tengo, The Clear, Tall Dwarfs, Alistair Galbraith, Brian McMahon, The Bruces, Iris De Ment, Beck, etc.....''Is being famous important to you ?''If it where I'd be making some other kind of music.''What's your song 'One For The Catholic Girls' about ?''It's about being heartbroken.''You seem to be influenced by Tom Verlaine and early Jonathan Richman, would you like to work with them ?''Oh, yes I love Television and The Modern Lovers but I don't really want to work with them. I wish people would just make their music and not worry about the past. I think it would be hard to concentrate or be honest in that context, where one has enlisted a giant. All the air in the room would evacuate.''What do you do when you're not making music ?''I work a couple of jobs, I spend time with the people I love, I read, write. Buy too many records, that kind of thing.''What would you like to have written on your grave?''\"So Long, It's Been Good To Know Ya\" Woody Guthrie. But I don't want a grave I'd rather be turned to ashes and then let go of. "

  "title": "The Songs and Art of Simon Joyner",
  "body": "By Lee Chung Horn, from Beta Music.The first thing about creating music for singer-songwriter Simon Joyner has always been the songs. The 28 year old musician from Omaha, Nebraska has no time for the publicity machine, badass rock star posturing or LA-style schmoozing. No, make that no experience. But Joyner is unembarrassed about assessing his own orbit as being so far beneath the radar of the music business as to be flying on the ground. This no-airs honesty clings to him like a cloak, enveloping the devout, minimalist indie-folk he's been making in the last eight years with a radiance rarely seen these days.His 1998 double-album opus Yesterday, Tomorrow and In Between blew up some sizeable waves in indie circles. On it, Joyner's unusual genius for detail and craft takes him to fuller rock arrangements, while once again reconfirming him as possibly the best practitioner of the Dylan school of lyric writing. Joyner has just released a new album called The Lousy Dance on the Truckstop label, and is planning a vinyl-only collection of covers of his favorite 60s and 70s obscure singer-songwriters. In a rare interview, Lee Chung Horn talks to Joyner about his art.''Tell us about yourself.''I was born in New Orleans in 1971. My parents are from Alabama. We made our way to Omaha, Nebraska compliments of the USAF which my father enlisted in when I was born. Carpentry wasn't paying the bills. I grew up mostly in Omaha but spent a significant time in the South visiting relatives over summers and vacations. I guess I perceive myself as a transplanted Southerner living in the Midwest, and alternately as a Yankee visiting Eden. I'd like to return to the South but it hasn't happened yet.''What is Omaha like musically? I've never visited, but I know the Golden Palominos and Counting Crows wrote songs about it.''Omaha is an alright music town. There are plenty of artists, solo and otherwise, and the crop of talent runs the spectrum from an aspiring DJ scene to mediocre and exceptional indie rock to free jazz, swing, folk, death metal, the obligatory ska and three-chord punk scenes. A town like any other I suppose. It's small enough that there is an enthusiasm about music which endears me to it. The people in large cities sometimes seem ungrateful for the music they have access to.''How do you mean?''Well, Omaha is large enough to be plugged in to what's happening elsewhere but not so large that people are blase when good acts come to town. Also, Omaha has one of the best record stores in the country, the Antiquarium Record Shop (www.antiquarium.com), which enables people to get the new sounds today.''How did you get into music?''I don't know what made Simon Joyner the songwriter and musician. I write quite a bit, I always have, and I don't necessarily mean songs. And I play some guitar. Mostly I listened to music voraciously. My father is a music lover and I grew up listening to the Beatles, the Stones, the Velvet Underground, Buffalo Springfield, Paul Simon, The United States of America, The Incredible String Band, Dylan, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen.''That's some musical education.''Yeah, my father had a large vinyl record collection which I cut my teeth on. I guess it was natural that I would try writing my own songs as I matured. I wrote fiction and poetry first and finally songs. It started off as a private thing, writing songs for friends to hear. I was urged to go public and although I was incredibly nervous about performing I really enjoyed it.''Many of your musical heroes are singer-songwriters.''My first wave of songs were confessional, from the Loudon Wainwright III school. They got me in a lot of trouble. Some people will never forgive me for things I said too directly when I first started singing my songs in public. Not that I would do it differently.''Did you ever listen much to punk rock? How much of the punk legacy surfaces in your work?''It wasn't until I was in my late teens that I began to appreciate music made in the late seventies and the eighties. Before I ever heard any of the punk rock, new wave, no wave of my lifetime I knew all the words to entire albums by Neil Young and Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan''Speaking of Loudon Wainwright III, have you heard his son Rufus Wainwright?''I have heard his album once or twice but I don't own it. It sounded pretty good. I love Van Dyke Parks' production. I haven't really sat down with it yet. My friend John Darneille of the Mountain Goats is a big fan of that record.''You've switched record labels quite a bit in your recording career. Why?''Well, people just ask me if they could put out a record, and if I like what they're doing, I say yes. With (record label) Shrimper it was for the pleasure of releasing a record on my friend Dennis Callaci's label. Sing, Eunuchs! is my homebase label, run by my close friend Chris Dedren. It exists to ensure that my records get released, and on vinyl. I jump around because there is no compelling reason to release records exclusively on a single label.''Your latest album Yesterday, Tomorrow and In Between has a lot of electric guitar on it. Is this your \"electric\" album?''Well, yes and no. My first vinyl record was called \"The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll\" and it had electric guitar all over it. The new record does have electric guitars on most of the tracks, it's true.''You play with a new band though. Who's in it?''Mike Krassner, Glen Kotche and Joseph Ferguson were in Edith Frost's band when I happened to play a string of shows with them a couple of years ago. We all got along so well that Mike and Joe offered to record my next record in Chicago at their studio Truckstop. They played on Yesterday, Tomorrow and In Between. Mike got Ryan Hembrey from Pinetop Seven to play bass on the record. My friend Alex McManus has been on all of my records since The Cowardly Traveller and he flew up from Nashville to play guitar. He's a member of Lambchop and Vic Chesnutt's band. His friend Deanna is also in Lambchop and she lives in Chicago so we asked if she would play some piano. Scott Tuma played in Souled American and he's a friend of Mike's so we asked if he would play some organ. Chris Deden played organ as well. Liz Conant played most of the piano parts.''What was the recording process like?''Basically we didn't have time to rehearse and I wanted it to have a live feel so we rehearsed the songs in the studio immediately prior to recording them. It kept things loose, and since they are all great musicians, it didn't end up sounding unrehearsed, just a little raw which is what I wanted. We overdubbed some piano and guitar and percussion tracks, but the core of every song was done live with little practice. Chris and Mike and I had discussed the record at length before we went into the studio and so we were able to let the musicians know what we wanted for the songs. Of course every one had their own ideas about what they wanted to do, and so we incorporated these ideas into the general idea of the sound of the record. It worked out well, I think.''Did it take long to record the whole album?''We recorded and mixed the record in a week. It was really rewarding because we realized the record in such a short period of time. I was used to recording in a practice space over a period of months, a day here, a couple hours there, until a record was done. That old way of working made it difficult to maintain focus. On this album I went into the studio with ideas and musicians simultaneously and it worked much better. It was more enjoyable as well''It strikes me you like writing in 3/4 time. There's a wrenching poignancy to it.''Well, I'm comfortable writing in a 3/4 time because it waltzes along in a driving kind of way, like a train or something, and there is always room for the lyrics. I like the space it creates, the mood it evokes. But I also like the sound of marches and I think it is a good time to tell a story in. It lends itself to narratives.''Dylan sounds like a big influence on your songs. How important is he to you?''Dylan changed songwriting forever for everyone. If the Minutemen are important to you then Dylan is important to you. If Alan Licht is important to you then Dylan is important to you. If Leonard Cohen is important to you then Dylan is important to you. You can't love music and not love Bob Dylan music. It's impossible. The Velvet Underground is Bob Dylan music. Do you know what I mean? Dylan is why you can hear \"Nowhere Man\" on muzak on elevators. Dylan is why \"Devil's Haircut\" is such a good song.''Tell me more about Dylan.''This question is too large for me this late in the hour. I think it's two a.m. or so. I guess I really got hungry for music making from listening to Dylan. His stripping apart and reconfiguring of song is inspirational. What he did with words in popular music is an unapproachable gift to the 20th century and forever.''Do you see a relationship between writing prose, poetry and music?''Yes, I do see a relationship between poetry, fiction and songs. Whether or not one believes that popular songwriters are making high art is irrelevant. Any lyric in any song is a communication, and is conveyed in a context which demands that it be perceived as such.''Do you feel you fit into any scene, or is that unimportant to you?''I don't really know how I fit into any scene. I'm oblivious to much of the business of rock. I pretty much make my records and tour and that's that. I'm aware of how mediocre much of indie rock is, but I feel I'm outside of this genre anyway. Indie rock is a big lake and I'm a little creek. What is there to do but make your music and release it? It's the consumer who determines the scene. If indie rock isn't making money it's because something else is. I'm outside all that too. There is a small bunch of people around the world who know about what I'm doing and that's just fine''Do you have a job, or are you able to make music your fulltime work?''I have two jobs. I am a partner at the Antiquarium Record Shop in Omaha, and I'm a partner at a place called Shock, a juice bar/vintage clothing store/art gallery. I also write children's stories and post-lapsarian dirges.''Really?''The hand-produced book department of the University of Nebraska at Omaha pressed 150 copies of a children's book I wrote called \"The Boy who wouldn't Sleep\". It's pretty much sold out now. Right now I'm looking to get it mass produced through some larger channel, a publisher I have yet to find. Know anyone who wants to put out children's books?''I guess like some of your fans I came to hear your music because John Peel played it on his World Service program.''Yes, Sir John Peel's been my passport out of total obscurity into the realm of the relatively obscure. I owe much to John Peel. Besides being the best DJ in the world, he has been incredibly generous with my music since the very beginning--from playing tracks from my first CD \"Room Temperature\" to playing the entirety of \"The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll\" to asking me to record a session for his program. His support of my music notwithstanding, he's clearly one of the unsung heroes of the 20th century "

  "title": "Olde Club Show Review",
  "body": "Omaha singer-songwriter Simon Joyner showed up at Olde Club this Saturday night and made us all proud. Joyner has been a favorite among the DJs on Swarthmore's WSRN for quite a while, and there were a number people who were eagerly anticipating the Olde Club event. Joyner's performance was bookended by two other bands, Bird Dog and The Renderers, both of whom also made a strong showing. The whole evening was an enjoyable one, although the energy was a little toned down from the usual Olde Club fare. Bird Dog consists of two members, a drummer and the guitarist/singer. The groups songs were mostly minor-y folk ballads, a lot of which had a distinctive kind of military pace. With a very quiet, country-boy attitude about him, the singer behaved like he had just spent hundreds of hours woodshedding in a barn in preparation for his first gig. He seemed very self-assured, though, and his quietness just made him more likable. I found myself paying more attention to the drummer than to the guitarist. His style was very brush-heavy, adding more texture than rhythm to the songs they were playing. The drummers unique style became even more apparent when he took out a seemingly homemade shaker instrument, strapped it on to his cymbals, and started worrying it with his drumstics. Even though it was not clear which band the drummer belonged to, at least the Bird Dog setup allowed him prominence on stage that he could not get in Joyner's larger ensemble. Joyner was just incredible. He came on with a full-sized band, but he did not necessarily have a fuller sound than Bird Dog did. The instrumental work was very angular and sparse, and only during the rousing choruses of some of his songs did it fill out any. When one listens to Joyner, however, one tends to forget the instrumentation and focus on his handsome, dog-howling voice. Sometimes it was warm, and sometimes cold, but there was always a delicate kind of mourning behind it. During most of his performance, I found myself sitting on the floor and hugging my knees like a kid listening to a story. As a top-notch songwriter, Joyners lyrics were not a surprise to a person familiar with his work, but his wonderful stage presence was. His recordings conjure up images of a man dying, singing from a wheelchair with a blanket covering his legs. However, in person he even seems vigorous like he could weather a winter in Minnesota as long as he had his good flannel shirt with him. Throughout the concert, Joyner remained particularly self-conscious. After one song, he apologized that the band was sliding all around up here, when they seemed to be doing perfectly fine. Between songs, he continually commented on how much fun the people at the WRC party next door seemed to be having. Despite what he may have felt about his performance, the performance clearly put everyone in the house into a glowing mood. To cap the evening off nicely, our own Jonathan Shainin, with whom the band had spent the previous night, accompanied them on a casio in the second to last number. His performance was hardly virtuosic, but it did make for a good fun time."

  "title": "To Almost No One: Singer-Songwriter Series, Volumes 1-5",
  "body": "This is a collection of five seven inch singles recorded in early 2001 by Simon Joyner and his trusty hometown band, The Fallen Men. Each side contains a cover version of a song by an obscure or overlooked songwriter from the 60s and 70s. The artists featured include Townes Van Zandt, Gene Clark, Jackson C. Frank, and the most treasured of all Scottish folk-singers-retreated-to-the-Western-Isles, Anne Briggs. The packaging was all hand-made and there were only 500 copies assembled, some of which are still available from Wee Black Skelf.== Tracklisting ==Volume 1:# To Live Is To Fly (Townes Van Zandt)# Midnight Through Morning (David Blue)Volume 2:# Sandman's Song (Anne Briggs)# For A Spanish Guitar (Gene Clark)Volume 3:# The Visit (Jackson C.

The collection of five vinyl singles begins with \"To Live is to Fly\" by Townes Van Zandt, and features Joyner's signature minimalist acoustic fingerpicking, and Lonnie Methe's soulful violin. Like the best cover songs, Joyner clearly adopted each song as his own, inserting his own musical energy to each composition. The next track, a cover of David Blue's \"Midnight Through Morning\" includes the line \"The radio played on to almost no one,\" which inspired the album's title. Gene Clark's \"For a Spanish Guitar\" was culled from Clark's White Light album, from his early singer/songwriter days. Joyner's version includes delicate guitar and Methe's violin, along with Brad Smith on organ. The cover of Jackson C. Frank's \"The Visit\" is a reflective narrative, with Joyner rising above his normal calm delivery. The version of Kris Kristofferson's \"Casey's Last Ride\" is the band's most collaborative track, with most of The Fallen Men making an appearance, including bassist Mike Tulis and Smith on drums. The band's version of Jim McCarthy's \"In Search of an Audience\" is a perfect example of Joyner's growth as a performer with the addition of The Fallen Men. The song features a liveliness to his voice not heard since his earliest recordings. The keyboard introduction to \"No More Songs\" leads off the final track of the collection -- a stunning and powerful collection of cover songs. The collection gives notice to some of the least-appreciated musicians of the '60s and 70s. Half of the songwriters have passed away, and some of the others have given up musical aspirations, most notably Kristofferson. Joyner wrote extensive liner notes for the collection, explaining his reasons for covering each song. \"Singer-songwriter music is a passport to obscurity by definition,\" he writes, perfectly illustrating his view on the man-and-his-guitar phenomenon. Steve Micek appears on horns on the collection, and Scotland's Wee Black Skelf Records released To Almost No One in 2002."

  "title": "Things Fall Apart: Simon Joyner Embraces The Beauty Of Breaking Down",
  "body": "By Chad Radford“I like things most when they’re on the verge of falling apart,” reveals Simon Joyner, the austere Midwestern indie folk fixture whose stark and fatefully autonomous sound has crystallized with pastoral and avantgarde purity. For more than a decade the Omaha, Nebraska singer/songwriter has honed his craft employing lyrical symbolism, crumbling imagery and an unassuming, post-Dylan mannerism to develop characters and conditions in his songs. Swaggering between ramshackle home recordings and humbly sophisticated studio output, Joyner’s warbling voice wafts over a procession of pianos, strings and percussive clatter giving rise to a drunken and deteriorating waltz. Myriad proficient players, including jazz icons Ken Vandermark and indie rock luminary John Darnielle (Mountain Goats) have contributed to his songs, but breakdown is inevitable.“It’s so exciting for me, watching to see if a group is going to get through a song,” he continues. “It forces people to stretch their ideas of what a song really can be, especially since the kind of music I make is not jazz, and it’s not drone music. There are chords that have to be played and to keep it exciting I like to throw as many wrenches into it as possible. Mess it up as much as I can without demolishing it. Take a pretty song and make it resist how melodic it really is so that people don’t know why it’s catchy, but it is. Even though it sounds totally distorted and dirty, it’s still a pop song.”Since the early ‘90s Joyner’s legacy of futility has been strewn across eight proper full-length recordings and dozens of singles and compilations. His songs have appeared on a smattering of under the radar outlets including Bloomington, IN’s Jagjaguwar Records, Chicago’s Truckstop Records and his own homespun label Sing, Eunuchs! As his more obscure offerings slip out of print, demand for his fleeting body of work only increases.Cutting his teeth in the burgeoning pre-grunge and lo-fi scene of Omaha in the early ‘90s as a folk singer, Joyner was a bit of a mismatch to his fuzzed-out and flannel-clad peers. Drawing comparisons to frazzled folk shouters such as Loudon Wainwright III and Bob Dylan to more pensive songwriters Will Oldham and Leonard Cohen, Joyner’s voice embodies a wry and literate tone. And though his songs have been publicly praised by everyone from Beck to fellow Nebraskan Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes), it was an early boost of confidence from over seas that kept him going.After finishing his first vinyl release ((The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll - Album|The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll)) in 1994 drummer and label partner Chris Deden mailed a copy to late British DJ and formidable tastemaker John Peel. He had done the same with ((Umbilical Chords)), Joyner’s first cassette demo in 1992, but Peel didn’t think much of it. His second release, ((Room Temperature)) garnered a few spins but it was The Cowardly Traveler that reeled him in. Although Joyner didn’t think much about it at the time, it led to a career changing act of fate that came to be known as the “Peel incident.”During one radio broadcast Peel played both sides of the record in it their entirety; an act only rumored to have happened one other time with an album by the Fall.This sparked a flurry of chatter amongst European music journalists, but at home in the states Joyner remained blissfully unaware of what Peel had stirred up. It wasn’t until touring in the Netherlands sometime later that it was brought to his attention. “All of these journalists had set up interviews with me and that was always their first question, ‘So how has your career changed since the John Peel incident?’” Joyner explains in a mock German accent. “I was like ‘What are you talking about?’ They filled me in and said it was absolutely unheard of for him to do something like that and that everyone there had been talking about it. I couldn’t even speak anymore.Over the years a friend of Joyner’s who lived in Germany had been sending him tapes of occasional broadcasts of Peel’s shows. Apparently he missed that one.To answer the journalists’ questions the Peel incident affected Joyner in more profound ways than increased record sales. “Once his support kicked in it made me feel less nervous about what I was doing,” he explains. “It gave it validity for me when I was still very much an underground name, even in the United States,” he continues. “To be in the place where he was and to listen to a crudely recorded record by someone that nobody had heard of and to say that it’s just as good or important as the Fall or Nirvana’s record, was great for me. Maybe he had some laundry to do or something,” he laughs. “It was a vinyl record so he at least had to sit there and flip it over.”Pressed in an edition of only 1,000 copies, The Cowardly Traveler has been canonized amongst fans as the holy grail of Joyner’s records. It’s “crudely recorded” aesthetic has morphed into a conceptual element of his music that transcends production qualities, often manifesting itself in pristine and professionally engineered recordings.Joyner’s two most recent efforts Lost with the Lights On (Jagjaguwar) and Stranger Blues (Catsup Plate), a collaboration with Dennis Callaci (Refrigerator/ lo-fi citadel Shrimper Records), polarize at opposing ends of his approach to making music.Recorded at King Sized Studio in Los Angeles with Michael Krassner (Edith Frost/Boxhead Ensemble), ((Lost With the Lights On)) is a dense and crystal-clear collection of songs that resonate with natural tones and impeccable sound quality. Stranger Blues resonates with a different character, evoking the grit and lo-fi din of his earlier homemade recordings. To Joyner, though the processes of recording and the outcome are different, it’s all part of the same body of work. “With Lost… I knew we were going to make a really nice sounding recording and I didn’t want it to sound too cold or sterile. The band ran through the songs once. I didn’t want them to learn their parts too well,” he adds, running through a list of performers on the record. Krassner along with Fred Longberg-Holm, Eric Heywood, Wil Hendricks, and Jim White played everything from bass and piano to an arsenal of electric and acoustic stringed instruments under the name “the Wind-Up Birds.” “These are all really phenomenal players, but I like putting them in a situation where they don’t have a chance to be perfect, because that’s where I am,” he continues. Krassner had been hired to mix something of some major label band and they asked him to book time in a studio. He booked time at Capital and hurried through it and used the rest of his hours to do my record.For ((Stranger Blues)), Joyner and Callaci convened under much humbler surroundings. “We recorded with one microphone plugged into a 1970s tube receiver he had in his living room,” he continues. “I don’t do a record in a studio because that’s the important one and these other projects get less attention. It’s just a different side to what I do and I really love doing them both. It’s all Simon Joyner music to me.”In October Jagjaguwar and Unread Records will release Beautiful Losers, a double LP/CD anthology of Joyner’s most obscure recordings. A reissue of his debut full-length, ((Room Temperature)) will follow in December. Bringing these songs back from the abyss gives a new platform for these fragmented works to reassemble and crumble apart all over again, ushering Joyner continually forward through the beauty of breaking down."

  "title": "Out Into The Snow",
  "body": "''Team Love Records'' - http://team-love.com/home/releases/tl-41/Simon Joyner’s twelfth record, Out Into the Snow, is another challenging and rewarding song-cycle which grows richer from repeated listening. For this outing Joyner has assembled a small group, including Alex McManus (Lambchop, Bright Eyes, The Bruces), Ryan Kennedy, Mike Friedman, Michael Krassner (Boxhead Ensemble), and Chris Deden, as well as background vocals by Sarah Gleason and Pearl Lovejoy Boyd and string arrangements by violinist, Laraine Kaizer. Sounding sometimes like Doug Yule era Velvet Underground (with some Paris 1919 John Cale thrown in for good measure), On the Beach period Neil Young , Happy/Sad era Tim Buckley, and Our Mother the Mountain period Townes Van Zandt, the album is littered with characters in transition, moving toward or away from complicated pasts and futures.Here you have a man floating away in a dilapidated drunken boat borrowed from Rimbaud. He escapes a past of imagined persecution, only to face deeper problems of self-identity after entering a storm at sea. There are lovers separated by distances difficult to summit. Others survive rocky starts to find peace, acceptance, and the real joy available to those who may have been born to run but now choose to stay and fight. The title tracks seems to be telling a simple story of friendship, but, after a man is called out on a winter night to rescue a friend in need, he goes to bed that night and has strange transformation dreams that lead him to question the direction of his own life. Stepping out into the snow then becomes a metaphor for engagement and risk. Joyner seems to be saying that life is full of these worthwhile struggles, whether they result in sorrow or mirth, pleasant or unpleasant discoveries. Joyner requires the same of himself artistically. Out Into The Snow is full of gorgeous human gestures from well-developed characters rising and falling in overlapping arcs of time. Brazen songwriting, like all great art, challenges even more than it entertains. Team Love is proud to introduce another milestone performance from Simon Joyner, perhaps the greatest songwriter you’ve never heard.== Tracklisting ==# The Drunken Boat# The Arsonist# Ambulances# Sunday Morning Song for Sara# Last Evening on Earth# Peace in My Time# Out into the Snow# Roll On"

  "title": "Interviews 10 Years Apart: Circumstantial Evidence 96 and yetmorebias 06",
  "body": "SIMON JOYNER: an interview in two parts 2006 (yetmorebias)We first caught up with Simon Joyner back in the Circumstantial Evidence days and have followed him ever since. We were even lucky enough to release a couple of his songs on some shitty cassettes we gave away with the mag - which have now been put onto the Beautiful Losers compilation for all to hear. Ten years passed and we caught up again to see what's going on... here's part 1 of the 2006 interview...Where did you go for the 4 yrs between Hotel Lives and Lost With the Lights On?Was that how long it was? Well, to be honest, the work was done in the same amount of time as usual. I generally record an album every year or year and a half. With Lost with the Lights On I was leaving Truckstop and the record sat in the can for a couple of years while I looked around for a label interested in releasing my records on both formats and making out of print titles available again. I wasn't really in a rush to release the record on a label that couldn't promote it well, so I just did other things and wrote more songs while I found a home for the record.Who's helping these days band-wise and what's on the horizon for you?I put an expanded version of my Omaha band the Fallen Men together to rehearse and record the new record. It's called Skeleton Blues and will be out in November on Jagjaguwar. I'd never really worked with a band over such a long period of time before. For most of my records I was performing with people for one week or so, just to make an album and do a few shows before disbanding. I like it that way. But I decided to put a band together, developing the songs over a longer period of time, letting the songs change and grow, before recording. I played these songs with these guys for over a year's worth of local shows before we recorded. Part of it was to see if I could maintain a band or if I really was essentially a solo performer who liked to play with different people all the time. But the other side of it was to let the songs go through a few interpretations before deciding which version to use on the record. It was a new thing for me. I'm usually completely in the moment with these songs, and happy to record them and move along. I'm really happy with the results. The new record is unlike anything I've recorded before. I have Dave Hawkins on guitar, Alex McManus on pedal steel and guitar, Mike Tulis on bass, Chris Deden on drums, and Lonnie Methe on organ and vibes. Michael Krassner flew in to produce the record and he ended up playing all the piano. Fred Lonberg-Holm did a string-arrangement for one song. It's a nice little rock and roll band. Now that the record is done I don't know what the future holds, band-wise. I was just granted a Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts residency and I'm currently working on a series of collaborations with other artists for a double LP project, with each LP side featuring a different collaboration. That will be an artist edition, not released through a label but probably available for order through my website and the distribution end of Jagjaguwar. I'm going to record the second installment of the singer-songwriter series 5x7\" boxset this summer and Jagjaguwar wants to put the songs from both 7\" collections on one CD sometime after it goes out of print. So that's a project that will happen some time in the future.I have too much stuff in the works right now so I'll probably have to stagger it out or risk flooding my little \"market\".Is there a reason why the songs have become longer / slower and less folksinger like over the years?I never was a folksinger. I'm post-Dylan, always have been. Early in my career I was limited to a guitar and vocal approach but even so, the songs were coming from a post American folk revival tradition, as much damaged by the Minutemen as by Leadbelly. Long and slow songs are very much in the folk tradition anyway, so maybe I'm becoming more folky, not less. Much of my kid furious routine was nerves early on. A lot of the songs on Room Temperature, for example, were heavily influenced by early Loudon Wainwright III, an excitable singer-songwriter in the post Dylan mold himself. I still write shorter, faster songs too. The songs are however long they need to be. People's attention spans keep getting shorter and shorter. What do they do with all the extra time they're saving with their impatience? They consume some other art or entertainment in a half-assed way, in most cases. They can't take a walk without making a call. They can't drive a car without checking their bank balance. All this time being saved but for what? If you listen to Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands and you say, \"damn, that's a long song\", than there is something wrong with you. That should be the last thing that comes to mind. It's like going to a museum and saying, \"that painting is so large.\" It's really beside the point, isn't it? Other people's limitations are not interesting to me. Now if someone tells me I could say the same thing in fewer verses, more effectively, than I'll listen. I can hear that argument.Is there a sound you are chasing?Yes, and it changes. With different records I'm chasing different sounds. You never catch it anyway. Chase is a perfect description, it's set up to fail. It's an unconscious thing, but intentional. Deprivation is the mother of all those interesting stories, paintings, songs, etc.... That's why it's much more interesting to hear a band fail to sound like the Beach Boys, but try, than it is to hear these bands that succeed in sounding like the Beach Boys. It's the unattainable that will force people to create something new.Have you worked hard at having a voice/sound that conveys Authority (a la Leonard Cohen); that needs only a few words to draw the listener in? You seemed to start out with a sort of Greenwich village words-tumble-out-fast approach...I haven't worked at making my voice a certain way but different songs have required different qualities from my voice at different times, depending on the subject matter, I guess. I sing em like I hear em. Not trying to be Authoritarian. Simon Joyner wants to be your lover, he doesn't wanna to be your boss.Part 2: September 2006How autobiographical DO the songs get (e.g. references in songs to Chris and Alex in Athens etc). Are the names kept in deliberately?I was on tour recently and stayed with this wonderful couple who took me to their favorite local bar. It was a delirious night, we played pool, drank far too much and had a great time, although we almost got in a bar fight with some people who wandered in sober and much too serious. Anyway, at some point in the evening the woman turned to me and said she was surprised I was capable of any levity at all after all the horrible things that had happened to me in my songs. She expected to be hosting a haunted brooding wreck of a man. It was pretty funny. Truth is, I haven't had an inordinate amount of pain in my life. Probably as much as any other regular person who tries to get the things he wants and does what he feels and keeps at it. It's just that when I write about people, what's interesting to me is the struggles they go through and how they come out of it. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good. Right? That's life. Moments of opportunity.Different people handle important moments differently. I write about them all, not just one kind of man or one kind of woman. I try and write about the other moments too, the levity and the \"unbridled\" joy, but it doesn't usually make much of a song, sort of \"our house is a very very fine house\" type of stuff. A hit song, sure, but a piece of crap too. But I can work those moments into a song that has more meat to it too and it helps give the stories more life. Anyway, what people are most affected by is the darker difficult business so that's what they tend to remember and what they in turn associate with me. If that's the case, and if you make the mistake of thinking all the first person narrators in my songs are stand-ins for myself, you're going to expect a much different person than me. In a way, that's good I guess. I mean, like Dylan says, I'm glad I'm not me, right? But those Frenchy philosophers also know that you are who people think you are too, whether you like it or not. I'm not so scary on the surface but sure I'm a brooding wreck in there somewhere and I guess that comes out too sometimes. But I also shoot some pool. Listen to Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" and you really want to think the story is essentially true, a re-telling, because of the line \"Sincerely, L. Cohen\" and the fact that \"Lily Marlane\" was a real person Leonard Cohen knew, right, but it's also a songwriting device. I mention people in my real life and I try to draw on the truth of what that person represents >to me but they usually haven't really said the things I have them saying in the song. I take (a lot) of creative license with people's names. It's a strange device because it gives me permission to write intimately, which is what is needed, but the freedom to make up whatever necessary to serve the ideas in the song. For example, in the song \"Evening Song for Sally\" I have the line \"Chris says you've got to lose your head sometimes to save your neck\" and my friend Chris never said that, but in my life he's the friend I would go to in one of my crises. It's true I was going through a really rough time, personally, when I wrote the songs on both Hotel Lives and then Lost with the Lights on. My marriage was falling apart and then it ended. Of course there is going to be a slew of ideas and sentiment that end up in the songs that wouldn't have otherwise ended up explored on those records, but the trouble in my life really just led me to dwell on these basic human issues and explore them artistically. It wouldn't be possible for me to write completely autobiographically about this stuff and put it out there for people to hear. You need some distance. I had to use my life as a starting point to write the songs but the goal is never to describe the details of my life in the song. I used my friend Chris' real name in the song so I could tell a truth, but not necessarily my story. Things as they are, are changed upon the blue guitar. Ha Ha. It's kind of a game, a way of writing these fictions but with real empathy. Becoming the characters or using some similarities to my life, when necessary. It's one of those lies that tells the truth, as the t-shirt said to the English professor. In the song \"Birds of Spring\" I have the line \"Maybe we'll visit Alex and Karen down in Georgia come this May, Maybe we're bound to kiss some coastline and say farewell to these haunted plains\". My friends Alex and Karen did live in Georgia so that's true, and other things in that song are true, but it's never all true. That line is a direct reference to the Townes van Zandt song Pueblo Waltz where he says \"Maybe we'll go to Tennessee, kiss these Texas blues goodbye, and see Susanna and Guy.\" He was singing about getting out of Texas and visiting Guy and Susanna Clark, but who knows if he was really singing about himself in the song or if he just put himself in there with that line as a little gift to them, an \"I miss you guys\" message, like Dylan giving John Lennon the little present of 4th Time Around, an alternating \"She/I\" song to the tune of Norwegian Wood. Sending out a private message in a public forum, it's cool, that's all. I was singing about getting out of Omaha and visiting my own songwriter friend and his wife down south. That line was my homage to Townes' song and it was a way of telling Alex and Karen I missed them. I hadn't seen them in a long time. Townes would sometimes insert real people into a song to give the song some sturdy legs to stand on. It makes it easy to sing those stories when you imagine yourself into a song like that. I like to do that too. So, to answer your question, I do this alot but you should read neither too much nor too little into it, I guess.The point is you can't trust anyone or anything, so the story or song or painting or poem or whatever is just what it is to you anyway; the history of it, the antecedents and the artifice and the prurient aspects of how the thing came into being are nasty entrance points and not important for knowing or understanding it. If you need to know that Pablo Picasso's friend committed suicide just before Picasso painted the Old Guitarist, in order to get into it, then you're not even in it for yourself, you're lost. However, it is nice to know that Billy Joel contemplated suicide before writing Piano Man, though we might question his timing on that one. I can promise you that if you ever catch me rhyming \"Davy\" and \"Navy\" or ordering a fucking \"tonic and gin\", it'll be before, not after I've contemplated suicide. Retyping that original interview with you I was interested in how you described the songwriting process: I don't really develop songs. I'm usually just doing something useful, like changing the oil in my car or clearing the wax out of my ears, and the song just comes to me and I just stop what I'm doing and go write it down in a little book I have for such occasions. It comes to me in the form of one lyric, one line, and I write it down and then all the others basically play follow the leader. Its not always the first line of the song; the verses often arrive out of order. Most of my songs are written in one sitting like that, maybe half an hour. After that I just iron out the dreadful parts. As far as the musics concerned, well, I just steal that from people who have more time than me for such inventiveness. I know I'm no Mozart. I cant read music and I can just barely play the guitar, so write a melody and Ill steal it, but so ineptly you'll think I actually thought ofit myself.Is that still the case? Especially with such a fleshed out sound on some of the recent songs - and have you recorded solo versions of the new songs to see how far they go before being recording with the band?That's pretty much my method. My answer was a little self mocking but it's true that I keep my music simple. All melodies in everybody's songs are just variations on other melodies. What I was trying to say is that while I can claim my lyrics, I'm aware of how much borrowing is inherent in putting music to words. That's just the way it goes. I can't hear somebody's song without catching melodic references to other people's songs. Of course once you settle on chords and a melody, you can dress it up however you like, and usually that's where the opportunity to make the music your own comes in. The sound might be more \"fleshed out\" on some recent records, but that's just instrumentation. The songs aren't really any more complex, musically. I always make tapes of the songs done stripped down on a guitar and listen to the tapes and think about what the songs need. I put thought into what the songs need or what they seem to want, but as far as chords and melody go, simpler is better in my book, for my purposes. Do you feel lonelier now or when you were a teenager growing up in your parents' place?Less lonely now. Part of being a teenager was having exaggerated sensitivities. Loneliness feels the same as it ever did but when it comes around now it's usually justified. It is a very careful, mannered sound, The World Of Simon Joyner. Do you feel those confines when you go to make a new album? Do you find yourself thinking 'i can't put that on there'?I'm not sure I understand what you mean about the sound always being careful and mannered. Different projects require different approaches. I don't think Lost with the Lights On sounds like Hotel Lives, and neither sound like Yesterday, Tomorrow and In Between or Songs for the New Year etc.... With Hotel Lives I did labor over how songs were going to sound. I was reaching for a certain sound and had definite ideas about how I wanted people to play on that record. Michael Krassner helped to achieve that. But with Lost with the Lights On we just did a couple takes and the band hadn't heard the songs until we were in the studio. My new record, Skeleton Blues, is with the Fallen Men and we spread out in a big warehouse space and recorded live. No studio. I've never overdubbed my vocals, preferring the natural mistakes and happy accidents of imperfect timing that comes with playing guitar and singing simultaneously. I dunno. I don't feel confined by anything, honestly. My audience is anonymous to me, I don't know who I'm impressing or not impressing or what they want or don't want to hear from me, so I don't feel any pressure from without, at all. It's whatever the batch of songs sounds like to me when I'm done writing them. Sometimes it sounds like a rock record, sometimes an orchestrated record, sometimes a stripped down acoustic record. It changes.I don't have any interest in making the same record over and over. I imagine no one really wants to hear the same record over and over, if they're honest about it. What has been your fave album of recent times?My favorite album of mine or of other people? I don't really have a favorite of mine, it's always the thing I just finished doing. As far as other people's records go, I'm really excited about the new Ed Gray record, called the Great Late Ed Gray, and there's a new Omaha band called Outlaw con Bandana and they have a vinyl only release called Life Without Outlaw. Great stuff. The not yet released new Refrigerator album is amazing. I tend to drift in and out of the present and past and it's hard for me to think of what I like when I'm on the spot. If i can be so bold as to quote back your own work \"to live on this earth you need two hands / one to crush the weeds that steal your crops / and one to crush your fellow man\". Pretty brutal stuff. Is that really how you feel? Did you once?\"...and a woman to tell you when to stop.\" That's the best part. No, that's not how I feel. That's just the character in the song. I hope you don't think I share the beliefs of all these people in the songs. These characters, they aren't all pretty but they're trying to make sense of their lives, and they come to some different conclusions, some unsavory justifications too. Like you or me, depending on our own stories, I suppose. Does slowing down the music = more confidence in The Song. Was the pace of the songs in the early days due to how the song was meant to sound or some manifestation of your nerves / lack of confidence in what you were doing?No, I don't think slowing down equals confidence in the song. Sometimes I just cram too many syllables into the lines and the only way to sing everything is to slow way down. It's always nice when I have a nice terse lyric I can pick up the pace with. I went back and forth in the early days too, say on Room Temperature and The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll. I had slow stuff like Grapefruit, Seizure, Joy Division, Montgomery, and faster stuff like Folk Song for Sara, Ruby Slippers, Appendix, Fallen Man. I was confident about all those songs. It's really just a sonic choice, I guess, that I'd make song by song. On my very first release, the cassette Umbilical Chords, I was nervous and unsure and I sped through the songs partially for that reason (partially because I was listening to a lot of Minutemen and other punk rock records too) but by the time I went to make Room Temperature I was feeling confident enough to slow down and have a go at actually singing some of this stuff. Unconscious Dylan references in song. You ended off the last round of Qs with this line: Simon Joyner wants to be your lover, he doesn't wanna be your boss. Which is obviously a line from a Dylan song turned on it's head (a classic Dylan songwriting technique in itself ironically enough) - did you use that intentionally or did it crawl out of your subconscious?It crawled out the window of my subconscious, which by the way, it would take a dump-truck to unload. How many times do you catch yourself putting lines in songs that have come from somewhere else and you haven't realized it - AND have any snuck through without you realizing it until it was too late?I've borrowed some good lines from bad songs of mine and put them into good songs, but I haven't caught myself accidentally borrowing lines from other people's songs. I do refer on occasion and that's intentional. I'm praying to be caught in those cases. How deep do the religious hang-ups in your work go?  Are you trying to work through something or is it just some kinda mythical imagery to draw upon?I don't have any religious hang-ups. That may be why it is so interesting to me. It's also a wealthy archive of imagery to draw upon, tools for getting across ideas. Religion is a way to make sense out of life for a lot of people, so I don't shut myself off to it. It's important to note that most religions persuade their members through good storytelling, and whether you are talking Greek and Roman myths, Old or New Testament, Hindi characters, stories of the Buddha, the Koran, the Torah, etc...you have to acknowledge these are great stories and they have human application otherwise they wouldn't be so effective. I'm a humanist like any other fanatic. I'm all for people. Religion is for the people, gods don't have any use for it. I may tangle with other people about cloud movements and what they mean, but I don't disagree that we have to live together and do right by one another. I just stop there while religious people tend to add a caveat that begins with \"unless\" and rounds out with \"...then they have to be removed.\"archived: SIMON JOYNER: interview (mid 1996)An interview that originally appeared in Circumstantial Evidence no 2 which also included interviews with Chris Deden and Bill Hoover. To this day this is still the best interview Ive seen with S.J. so spend some time wading through itList all the reasons why Simon Joyner is Not Important Music.Well, Ive always believed that music exists for the same reason that the Sistine Chapel was built; to give people a place to worship. Despite the depth of my belief that this is true (I must confess finding spiritual enlightenment in the music of others throughout my lifetime), I dont think that makes it important. Im talking about worshipping life, not god, by the way, and I believe that the celebration of life in all its manifestations is integrated into all aspects of simply living it, music being just one aspect and no more or no less important than any other. Nevertheless, you might be hard pressed to find anyone to agree with that notion. Im not sure I could even sign my name to it when I think about listening to Double Nickels On the Dime for the first of hundredth time or various other records which are indisputably important to me. Its like Ramon Speed says: youll never know what My First Bells means to me. Youll never know and I cant make you see. So , the thing is that I knew music could be thought of as important but I didnt want anyone to think I thought I was one of those thoughts. I guess I named my publishing company Simon Joyner is not important music because I didnt want to put on any airs, you know. Ive never felt that it was any artists place to tell others to listen to him or her or read him or her or stare prostrate for hours into his or her paintings. Also, its a seemingly pretentious thing to release music under your own name. Its much easier to be in a band. You can always say its a group effort. Maybe I was just fishing for someone to say no Simon, you are important music. No such luck! You know Mark Twain said that its better to remain silent than be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. Tell your readers I was just removing doubt.List all the reasons why Simon Joyner does exist.Well thats easy enough. My body has yet to succumb to the laws of nature. My unconscious is very organized, so much so that my blood keeps circulating, my pancreas continues excreting vital hormones, my tissues absorb stress to the body, my lungs have got rhythm etc. All without any effort on my part. What a deal! When the desk in my brain begins to look likt the desk in my room there will be no excuse for my existence and Ill start singing so long its been good to know you in that ¾ time Im so fond of these days.Was there one song you heard that made you decide you wanted to do this? Does music still mean much to you?You ask damn good questions. I remember my papa playing Desolation Row for me when I was little. It was fascinating, full of characters doing strange things, and Dylans voice was like, well, how I imagined god to be; in the sense that he really seemed to be an authority in that crazy universe he was singing about. He sang it with the conviction on an omniscient. He could be watching Ophelia go swimming, Einstein dragging the clergy along behind him, and he knew where Dr Filth kept his world. That song made me dream about singing like that. It gave me the desire but it was so completely beyond what I believed was possible that the dream lay dormant for many years. Ahh, what happens to a dream deferred? One day, a friend of my pas named Don played me the song Heroin by The Velvet Underground. Now this was the voice of someone not so sure of himself, and the words werent as cryptic and intentionally symbolic and the images werent obscure. The words were hot impulses, it seemed, and flew out of his mouth in bursts. It was all about desires, not the intellectual desires of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captains tower, but desires of identity and self-worth. I wish that I could sail the darkened seas on a great big clipper ship. Im going to try for the kingdom if I can What was this if I can business? It was chock-full of wishes and qualifications. Thats when it seemed like a real possibility, songwriting. I thought I could try this. Lou Reed made an incredible song out of naked desire and the frustration of having to rise to an occasion. Dylan had desire, sure, in spades; but lets face it he was the occasion. Of course I couldnt imagine doing this songwriting stuff until I heard someone great, like Reed, who wasnt singing with that unwavering confidence that made Dylan sound like god. If you feel like revealing such stuff, how does a song develop for you and what length of time are we talking?I dont really develop songs. Im usually just doing something useful, like changing the oil in my car or clearing the wax out of my ears, and the song just comes to me and I just stop what Im doing and go write it down in a little book I have for such occasions. It comes to me in the form of one lyric, one line, and I write it down and then all the others basically play follow the leader. Its not always the first line of the song; the verses often arrive out of order. Most of my songs are written in one sitting like that, maybe half an hour. After that I just iron out the dreadful parts. As far as the musics concerned, well, I just steal that from people who have more time than me for such inventiveness. I know Im no Mozart. I cant read music and I can just barely play the guitar, so write a melody and Ill steal it, but so ineptly youll think I actually thought of it myself.       Is it a case of having a pile of songs and then deciding which ones need touching up (extra musicians etc) or are they all premeditated?I pretty much play solo when I do shows and its only when its time to record that I think about the songs in a broader context and decide what kind of instrumentation they need. Thats when I enlist Alex McManus on violin, Bill Hoover on banjo or accordion, Chris Deden on piano and drums, Joyce Roper for cello needs and others for what comes up. The arrangements are arrived at through a frustrating blend of trial and error. They change so much during this process that they often seem like completely new and different songs to me. Thats all you want to hear by the time youre done recording anyway.Are the words the most important thing?Well, I guess if you showed me the typed-up pages of Crucifixion manuscript by Phil Ochs, I would probably have a hard time looking at it and saying its only rock and roll but I like it. That doesnt mean I think its intrinsically better than Wild Thing however. Its all a matter of context. I cant keep my mouth shut so words are really my only signposts. If I had a better voice I would use it a lot more effectively and cut down on the verbiage. You cant imagine what Id give to have written Crazy by Willie Nelson or Only the Lonely by Roy Orbison. Somehow in a two and a half minute window they tear your heart out and put it back together in time for you to sing along with the fade-out. The words are everyones words, nothing extra; all true, to the point, and a voice that goes in through your ears and leaves through your nose. But now its confession time. Ive never cried listening to a song that didnt have words; not a drop. Without the few words Crazy and Only the Lonely do have, they probably wouldnt work. so, yes, the words are the most important thing to me. Yes, Crucifixion is a better song, but you cant whistle to it. Words are very needy things.Was it deliberate to go from the Dante reference of Cowardly Traveller through to Heavens Gate? Whos your Beatrice?You give me too much credit for that kind of foresight. No, it wasnt deliberate. Besides, my character bounces off of heavens gate, falls down and then takes the lords name in vain. Thats a far cry from the purified Dante who is granted a personal viewing of the holy trinity. I do, however, think of Heavens Gate as a resolution of whatever my problem was while writing The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll. Also, I believe in the idea that there are those who guide us out of spiritually purgatory and lead us elsewhere, somewhere better, like Beatrice did for Dante. Chris (Deden) is my Virgil and Beatrice goes by the name of Josephine.Is it true: I want to be an honest man, as honest as I can or is it all just varying shades of the truth depending on what day it is etc?There are varying shades of the truth, sure, but then there are outright lies. The truth is subject to the uncertainty principle. You cant see it so clear the closer you look at it. I would like to be as honest as I can which means, for me, cutting down on outright lies, and expanding the palette to make room for all those shades of truth scrutiny dreamed up. I made that statement knowing that it was just a dream and a wish and Im aware of the battles human nature wages with dreams and wishes. I try to think positive, despite what they say.Is the new record a departure from the old stuff?The record I just finished recording (Songs For the New Year) has a bit more instrumentation than Heavens Gate, but not much. Lots of piano and drums and violin and cello. There is some lap steel and pump organ as well. A lot of the songs were written around the time I wrote the last batch, or shortly thereafter, so they have that mood to them. Ive got no objectivity about it yet.  theres a guitar leaning on a marshall stack / it used to sound like the sun on the horizon now I think weve been had (Uncle Tupelo). Discuss.I cant place this Uncle Tupelo lyric. Im guessing its from their last record, which I never bought, because I have the other three and this doesnt ring a bell. At any rate, it seems hes probably talking about himself and the troubling notion that he isnt sixteen any more and maybe doesnt perceive rock and roll through those innocent eyes. Perhaps the vanishing act his romantic ideas have played on him makes him feel like hes been robbed of his innocence. I dont know. I only wish he had said now I think Ive been had, because for many people discovering the joy in the sound of a guitar leaning on a marshall stack, it feels like the opposite of being had; its more like being saved. I can relate to something at the root of this lyric of course. There was a time when everything I heard, I was hearing for the first time. Thats a wonderful time of discovery, when I was devouring everything I could get my hands on, and one I cant really reclaim. When I find records that Ive been looking for for a long time, it doesnt quite have the impact that it would have had then. That doesnt make me jaded though. I love music and I cant really get enough of it. Im just not innocent about it anymore. This nostalgia can kill you, you know. Its best to not look back if you cant do it without feeling self-pity. And if you do feel self-pity, call it that and dont drag the rest of us down with you. I bought a Zumpano record today and those guitars did sound like the sun on the horizon to me! What do I want some college boy jacking off to me about the working man when I know he hasnt ever had guitar calluses prickling up his soft hands anyway? Thats hard enough to swallow, but then to have that same person turn around and tell me rock and roll is going down the tubes, and all of us are going right down with it for ever believing in it in the first place, its just a load of shit. Thats just my opinion. Now Im all worked up. Im sorry for losing my cool here. I really cant comment on this lyric because to do so would be taking it out of context and unfair to the songwriter. That last sentence was written by the Simon Joyner Damage Control Committee. I really do like Uncle Tupelo, by the way. Especially the songs by the one who doesnt write about labour struggle, scabs, being kissing cousins with Joe Hill, unions, strikes, coal mines, hard work and other things he knows nothing about. I dont know who wrote that last sentence. Now Black Eye, thats a song.Your backing band of choice.Either Crazy Horse or the Frantic Elevators, I guess, if this is one of those fantasy band questions.Do you find yourself simplifying your music as you go, or trying to make it more complex?I wish I could say that Im making a concerted effort one way or another, but Im afraid Im not. I really havent learned much guitar beyond what I knew to begin with, so that limitation keeps things pretty simple. I dont think that adding instrumentation makes it more complex really. It hopefully hides the fact that I havent really learned much guitar beyond what I knew to begin with. It could be that Im unconsciously simplifying or complicating my songs as I go along but if so, I would obviously be unaware of it. What do you think? I know I used to feel a pressure to learn all those diminished chords and complicate everything but I never could learn them and I think I just setted into A, B, C, D, E, F, G and A minor, D minor and E minor. Thats the short and long of it.How much of an influence are the following on your songs: alcohol, cigarettes, regret, unrequited love and religion. Is there a god? What does he / she think of Simon Joyner?Alcohol and cigarettes have no influence. Theyre just scenery, just descriptive. Im more interested in things that have real power to move people into a state of flux, where a transformation or revelation might occur. Regret and unrequited love are powerful in that way and so they have an influence in what I write about. Even if Im writing about a person drinking and passing out, the alcohol is just peripheral while the regret or the unrequited love might be what put him there. I dont empathize with self-destructive people because theyre self-destructive but because something made them that way and I might know something about that something. Acknowledging what is important about a persons story so that it can be addressed in a song makes it possible for writing to be therapeutic, in a way. I used to believe that was rubbish when singers said that music was their therapy. I thought it was more like an ecasion of much needed therapy, but I have since written about myself enough to know that its true. Ive honestly surprised myself by revealing the true nature of my own situation when I had previously believed I was writing a completely different type of song altogether. When the song was finished it was not, for instance, a grudge song or a love song at all, which in themselves usually remain two-dimensional, but sometimes much more meaningful to me. If I wasnt trying so hard to write a good song I dont think I would begin to approach my problems as critically and honestly (or as soon) as I do. I know you didnt ask about that but I just ramble, sorry. Of course not all the songs are about me specifically, but I wouldnt write them if I couldnt relate to them on some level. Oh, I forgot religion. Basically I find religion useful metaphorically. I believe in the desire to seek and enrich life. I believe in the pit of the soul where hopelessness swings. I believe in the journey out of darkness. I can completely relate to these spiritual hungers and still apply them to secular living, the art of living. In fact, as far as Im concerned, its all the more important to fill all the empty spaces in my soul if there is no god. If this is it, make the once-go-round worth all the damages you incur and inflict while youre breathing. For me, I want to understand myself and find some answers to a lot of questions and peace through discovery of my earthbound possibilities; n ot peace through humble resignation to something incomprehensively great. But religion is a powerful motive for others, and so I utilize it for that purpose. In a song like Prometheus I tried to use it to show the ambivalence faithful people feel when they encounter evil in their lives. The desire to strike back at god has got to be great. On the other hand, I also tried to show how corruptible or vacant some peoples faith really is. When they are needy they look to god but not until then, and when god doesnt answer their prayers in a way that they can comprehend they get spiteful. I think the root of this is a lack of pure faith because the truly faithful view themselves as orbiting around something much greater so that even their personal suffering is part of a larger, more important plan, while those with impure faith ultimately, albeit unconsciously, perceive god as revolving around their lives and fitting in when needed. Religion seems to me to be a man-made connection between ourselves and our imagined superior power which we create because we rightfully dont trust ourselves to do the right thing instinctively. Those who see god revolving around us have imperfect faith because they arent able to think of our life as not important. Religion would be awfully poorly designed if we were all able to see ourselves revolving around god. The people who struggle with their faith must occupy the largest percentage of the population because they must believe enough to live justly and humanely, but doubt enough to keep us ahead of him in their priorities. So the saints can lead selfless, generous lives, and the martyrs can go ahead and drive that car loaded to the gills with dynamite into a building in the service of their god while the rest of us think twice and say what no rain? or hey, whyd you let Candice get brutally raped and murdered and left to freeze in a cornfield? or how come I never win the lottery?. If it all boils down to what have you done for me lately? Im sure the human race will continue to continue.I wish Id written that line we may not cause a ripple but we can sink with grace. Is that how you try to live your life? Antoni Tapies said the art of living: of making life as beautiful as possible which means similar things to me.Yeah, I guess that is how I try to live my life. Try. It may not be an important life in the long run of humanity but while Im here I intend to make it a good visit, hopefully sharing and learning and making life as beautiful as possible. Thanks for that quote. Also, I may not cause a ripple but theres no harm in trying either. I have no fear of failing, however, because I believe simple lives are just as good as complicated lives. I hope the statement doesnt evoke hopelessness because it wasnt my intention. I am going to try for the kingdom, if I can. The kingdom just varies from person to person. Bob Dylan said on the album New Morning that to have a couple of kids who call me pa and to sit around and catch rainbow trout must be what its all about. Sounds good to me, and coming from a man of no small amount of soul searching.The Simon / Chris Deden / Bill Hoover story as you see itChris and I met back in high school. I used to tell tales to my homeroom class, trying to draw attention to myself. That was before I was shy at all. I told these exaggerated stories because homeroom was so boring and everyone was half asleep anyway. I was just trying to wake myself up, I guess. Anyway, Chris is the only one who ever laughed, no matter how much I hammed it up. He just sat and watched me like an over-serious child watches a clown pop out of a barrel at the circus. I thought he hated me. Then one day as we were leaving homeroom to go to our first classes I started singing the lyrics to Alison by Elvis Costello, and he grabbed my shoulder from behind and I turned and he said hey, you like Elvis Costello?. We became best friends very quickly and in doing so I gradually became a bit more reserved and he, in turn, became a little bit more obnoxious, that is outgoing. We met Bill and other notable Omaha sacred monsters Alex McManus and John Kulman a few years later when I started playing shows at the late great Kilgores, a bar in mid-town Omaha. I cant remember the specifics but Bill and Alex and John and I all liked one anothers music and we just started setting up shows together and pretty soon it was a regular gig at Kilgores every Thursday night. We packed the place, we really did. All of us were competing with one another. It was expected that we would all bring at least one new song a week to play but we all tried to outdo each other and bring two or three, one of which had to be really good. We sized each other up a bit, drank a bit, and everyone had a bit of a ball. But tragedy hit Kilgores in the form of some M.I.P.s that dealt a severe financial blow to the place. The owner closed shop and then rented it out to a theater troop who renamed it the Shelterbelt theater. It was never the same after that. My chronology may not be perfect but it went something like that. Were all good friends and theyre great musicians so its only natural for me to ask them to help my songs along when it comes time to record.How close do you align yourself with the Icarus figure?Icarus should have listened to his papa, Daedalus, who warned him to fly low away from the sun. Icarus was pretty stubborn, thought he knew more than the man who single-handedly invented the labyrinth and the means from escaping from his father. Not very smart on his part, Id say. I feel for Daedelus mostly, because he outlived his son and no-one wants to do that. I try to listen to my father now that Im older and wise enough to know that he is wiser than i. Icarus paid the price for that kind of freedom and went down singing Im forever blowing bubbles. Meanwhile, I suppose, rock bands began cropping up in Crete, adopting live fast, die young credos which included Icarus lives pins stuck all over their torn tunics. Whether I close my eyes or keep them open, I still hear Icarus splashing all around me, every day."

These will be limited pressings; in fact, they're only making as many as they have orders for ahead of time. This allows Grapefruit to pay all bands in full, in advance, without anyone having to wait for a record to \"break even.\" They are not selling to distributors and these records will not be in record stores at all--only available by subscribing. The first year roster is incredible. It includes exclusive albums by Lambchop (early, rare, pre-Merge recordings), Richard Youngs, L. Eugene Methe (Rake Kash, Spiritual Rags, The Naturaliste), and 200 Years (Ben Chasny from Six Organs of Admittance & Elisa Ambrogio from Magik Markers) and a deluxe slipcase box to hold all four records in the annual series. The artists are on loan from other labels and ever-changing so each year will be a unique, diverse line-up. They intend to mix it up as much as possible, the only criteria being that Ben and Simon both love the music. If they get at least 300 subscriptions a year, the boat will float, so please check out the website to subscribe or buy a gift subscription (GrapefruitRecordClub.com), find Grapefruit on Facebook and MySpace and Twitter, and tell any collector friends and loved ones about it.  They'll be taking this year's subscriptions from Thanksgiving to Valentine's Day and the first record will come out in April. == Limited Vinyl Only \"Spiritual Rags\" LP by SIMON JOYNER & CHRIS DEDEN & LONNIE METHE ==From the Unread Records website description: The trio of simon joyner, lonnie methe & chris deden culminate and record a spattering of concrete dirge and ballad that treads upon the razors edge...songs topple upon themselves and shatter your weak vision of what appears to be \"home\" - graveyard blues, and hobbled hopes force their way into near psych territory, yet follow through and blurt their way back into and out of your heart. limited to 300 copies in \"recycled\" silkscreened jackets. no two are alike. co-released with grotto records.Recorded over a weekend at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts during Joyner's 2005 residency there, this sat on a shelf for five years but is finally being released on Unread.

Instead of performing in the typical indie rock venues and bars with, he would like to explore a more intimate setting for these shows—living rooms and art spaces around the country and enjoy. The house (or art space) show removes the elevated stage that separates the performer from the audience. It removes the distracting noise from the bar and provides an environment that allows the music to be the main focus is searching.  Simon has always felt that house shows and D.I.Y. spaces are often the best places to perform  but it hasn’t been feasible to base a tour on this preference until now reading effective.If you’d like to host a show or express interest in attending a show, please visit http://simonjoynertours.com. Simon is planning on going to the Southeast U.S. in March, the Northeast in May, and the West Coast in July 2010. If the house show tours work in the U.S. he's going to try the same model in the U.K. and Europe.== New Record \"Out In The Snow\" --- release date SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 on Team Love records ==http://team-love.com/home/releases/tl-41   1. The Drunken Boat\\   2. The Arsonist\\   3. Ambulances\\   4. Sunday Morning Song for Sara\\   5. Last Evening on Earth\\   6. Peace in My Time\\   7. Out into the Snow\\   8. Roll On\\   \\Simon Joyner’s twelfth record, Out Into the Snow, is another challenging and rewarding song-cycle which grows richer from repeated listening. For this outing Joyner has assembled a small group, including Alex McManus (Lambchop, Bright Eyes, The Bruces, , Ryan Kennedy, Mike Friedman, Michael Krassner (Boxhead Ensemble),  and Chris Deden, as well as background vocals by Sarah Gleason and Pearl Lovejoy Boyd and string arrangements by violinist, Laraine Kaizer. Sounding sometimes like Doug Yule era Velvet Underground (with some Paris 1919 John Cale thrown in for good measure, On the Beach period Neil Young , Happy/Sad era Tim Buckley, and Our Mother the Mountain period Townes Van Zandt, the album is littered with characters in transition, moving toward or away from complicated pasts and futures. Here you have a man floating away in a dilapidated drunken boat borrowed from Rimbaud. He escapes a past of imagined persecution, only to face deeper problems of self-identity after entering a storm at sea. There are lovers separated by distances difficult to summit. Others survive rocky starts to find peace, acceptance, and the real joy available to those who may have been born to run but now choose to stay and fight. The title tracks seems to be telling a simple story but, after a man is called out on a winter night to buy a, he goes to bed that night and has strange transformation dreams that lead him to question the direction of his own life. Stepping out into the snow then becomes a metaphor for engagement and Joyner seems to be saying that life is full of these worthwhile struggles, whether they result in sorrow or mirth, pleasant or unpleasant discoveries. Joyner requires the same of himself artistically. Out Into The Snow is full of gorgeous human gestures from  well-developed characters rising and falling in overlapping arcs of time . Brazen songwriting, like all great art, challenges even more than it entertains. Team Love is proud to introduce another milestone performance from Simon Joyner, perhaps the greatest songwriter you’ve never heard. == Cowardly Traveller Re-release ==From Simon's Myspace --- \"Cowardly Traveller lp/cd reissue out May/Team Love\".  It is available now on 180g vinyl and CD from Team Love (cat. number TL-016).== Archived News ==* ((News 2007))* ((News 2006))* ((News 2005))* ((News 2004))* ((News 2003))* ((News 2002))* ((News 2001))"

  "title": "Einstein disguised as Robin Hood",
  "body": "by Eric F.the french version can be found there\\http://www.mille-feuille.fr/Modules/Interviews/Fiche/?i_id=71 - What first got you into music (as a listener and then as a performing artist)? Do you remember the first song you ever wrote?I remember listening to the song \"Duncan\" by Paul Simon, over and over in bed with headphones during an especially hot summer in Prattville Alabama at my grandmother's house. It was an eight track tape of my father's. I was spending the summer there with my grandmother, running around barefoot picking peaches and getting bitten by fire ants, trolling the creek, then at night I'd lie in bed with these huge headphones and listen to Duncan until I fell asleep. Huckleberry Finn scenarios. I was probably seven years old and had never lived away from my parents for an extended period of time. I found a box of my father's old love letters and strange photographs from when he was in high school (I was staying in my dad's old room) and was experimenting with independence at the same time that I was finding out real things about what my father must have been like as a teenager. I listened to that song Duncan over and over, memorizing all the words. My younger brother is named after this song, by the way, and I was named after Paul Simon. The song tells a linear story, a story I couldn't totally understand at seven years old, but one that was very addictive and not entirely hopeless. It was just right for a kid my age whose parents fought all the time and who was starting to think that if anything was going to happen to him in this life it would be because of choices he made for himself, good or bad. My world felt pretty shaky at the time. I remember thinking that I was named after this guy telling this story and that meant he was really important to my parents and it gave the song a lot of added weight. It was as if by understanding the song I might understand my folks somehow. It helped a little in that respect but more than that, it made me start thinking about songs, what they can do and what makes them good. The song \"After the Goldrush\" by Neil Young did a similar thing. I remember being in sixth grade and I walked a few blocks to school every day and I used that time alone to sing that song over and over even though I had no idea what it was all about. There was a definite story being told and a feeling conveyed that meant more to me than anything I was learning in school. It was absolutely mesmerizing to me, that world, that voice. Real songs are other-worldly a lot of times, I'd even say magical in the sense that they are essentially tricks being played on you, but good tricks, tricks we need. Here's a first line to remember someone by, \"Well i dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming saying something about a queen.\" What a great opening line. Same with \"Couple in the next room, bound to win a prize, they've been going at it all night long.\" I could go on and on. Another big one as a little kid was \"Desolation Row\" by Dylan. All these run-ins with great songs happened in a short period of time when I was really young. I was pretty lucky in that sense. My father sang all these songs too and played guitar. I knew \"All Around the Water Tank\" backwards and forwards before I was eight years old. My dad had a large vinyl collection heavy on the 60's and 70's singer-songwriter records including Ochs, Tim Buckley, Dylan, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, Kris Kristoffersen, etc... and as soon as I showed the slightest interest in music, he started playing me everything he wanted me to hear. Bob Dylan almost ruined my life because he was just too great, unreal. Not a real person. Desolation Row replaced After the Goldrush as my favorite song and it led me to great books and plays and in some small way almost to a degree in history. It at least made me conscious of historical figures and I liked the idea of using them towards new ends, that they weren't necessarily frozen in time. In fact, they are only frozen in the sense that our minds are made up about them, not that we necessarily got them right when we wrote their stories down in the first place. So, yes, I'll take more Einsteins disguised as Robin Hood. Anyway, the song is dense and Dylan never kowtows to his audience or condescends either. He writes independent of his audience, like a god or something. Pretty scary, actually, that kind of confidence. Pretty attractive too, hence all the messianic guitar players we've all known or become in our lives. At any rate, Desolation Row made me think I'd never be able to write songs, sort of like reading Raymond Carver makes you think you have no business trying to write short stories. So when I finally got the courage to write songs it was actually \"Heroin\" by the Velvet Underground that let me in. I've told that story before, I won't bore you with it, but basically it was because Lou Reed's was a less confident voice, it was a shaky sincere mess of a man who sang that song. That felt attainable to me and even though I wanted to write Desolation Row, my first songs all sounded like Lou Reed impressions, because Dylan was out of the question. I don't remember the first song I ever wrote, wish I did. I wrote some songs in eighth grade though, some really bad songs. Brazen, heart on the sleeve, tortured stuff. I really got serious about it a year later though, writing poems and turning them into two chord rants. I still sacrifice whatever I have to musically in order to say what I need to say. Ideally the two go together but sometimes you just have to go back and forth between two chords and let it out, forget about anything else.- Looking back on all of your songs, is there one you're more proud (or ashamed of) than the others? If so, why? Are your favorite Simon Joyner songs the same as your fans'?It's hard to say. I don't really think of my songs as independent of the albums they are part of, so I categorize them according to periods of time. There are Lousy Dance songs, Songs for the New Year songs, Heaven's Gate songs, Lost with the Lights On songs, etc... and for each period of songs there are some that mean more to me for whatever reason. It doesn't mean they are better songs, usually it's something sentimental about writing the song that brings me back to it over and over. Some songs are really hard to ever play again because they were written at a certain time and I don't know how to transpose them for another time and have them be honest in the same way. That's a constant challenge, especially when reinterpreting songs written in my early twenties. Some feel as natural as the day I wrote them but others aren't so easy to sing anymore so I don't. I have no idea what songs fans like. I have a song called Double Joe from my first real record, Room Temperature, that people in Omaha used to request all the time but aside from that I'm happy to say that I get requests for a lot of different songs from across my whole \"career\" and that makes me happy. It doesn't seem to be just the same few songs that everyone wants to hear.- Would you say that your geographical whereabouts are important at the time you write and do they influence the way the song will end up sounding like? More generally do you feel like Omaha can be heard in what you do?I think the importance of geography can be overstated. It's easy to romanticize a location, give it powers it doesn't have. Most of that stuff is in your mind but having that stuff in your mind can create the same effect, I guess. For me, I have to say that seasons have more influence than geography. Living in Nebraska, a place with four distinct seasons, means I have a few different waves of creativity. Basically, change in the weather causes reflection. Reflection is good for art, so being here is good for me. I think Omaha plays some part in what I do for that reason and for others. It's where I've lived most of my life and the people I've written about are people from this part of the country, for the most part. I'd like to think that people transcend their environments more often than not, and songs about these people are not really about Omaha or the Midwest or America so much as those geographical aspects are part of a larger palette that's more universal. There is space and an urban/rural struggle going on in Omaha and that's interesting to me too. We live next to a river that gets no respect. It might as well not be there. People are floating and landlocked and everything seems really far away which forces people to develop a kind of independence that borders on insanity. You know, a cockiness about individual needs that leads to attitudes like 'if it isn't here than who needs it. Fuck it, everything I need is right here.' If Omaha had more to offer, this would make sense but it's limited in some crucial ways and that's why I say people are a little insane because what they're really saying is that they aren't willing to do whatever hard work is necessary to make those distances seem not so great. They deny certain limitations and replace it with a sense of pride and loyalty that isn't entirely grounded. I'm not saying it's that way for everyone. I'm a writer and a performer and I really do get what I need out of Omaha and see other places for other things. Some people create culture in a town that shirks it more often than not, so they don't suffer, but I'd say there are a lot of lives that could be busted open and doing something interesting but instead get trapped and ignored in a smaller city like this one. Musically, I don't know. People want to read into the speed of my songs, the way I take my time. I guess that's a Midwestern trait. I'll own that, maybe that's geographical, but it could just as easily be because I like stories and fully fleshed out characters and because Dylan and Neil Young and Leonard Cohen all wrote long songs and didn't allow the attention span of their audience to dictate how they went about singing their songs either.- You are quite close to different people such as Connor Oberst and John Darnielle, do you feel like belonging to some kind of common community or something?I've never really felt like I was part of a community, not with music anyway. There are musicians I'm close to who make music I enjoy and their friendship (and music) is definitely important to me. Some of them are more involved with other people's music in a way that fits that description of community but I don't have that, unfortunately. I'm not sure why, I guess it's just my surly disposition. I think that being part of a community requires a kind of sublimation that doesn't come naturally for me. I wish it did, community must be a good feeling, but if I have a sense of community it takes a form more akin to respect and admiration. These are things I feel for other songwriters involved in the same processes but I'm not in their business trying to be part of it. I think there is a watering down that happens when too many competing voices are involved in the same projects. This is how a regional \"sound\" develops, a lot of inbreeding. Disparate voices gradually merge, edges get filed down, loose cannons and crazy characters retreat to the background, leaving a bunch of bands that sound the same. It happens over a period of time and no one knows when it's happening to them so it's up to everyone to be careful not to get too involved in what other people are doing musically or to let other people care too much about what you are up to musically.-How do you feel about Bright eyes covering Burn Rubber or Joy Division? Do you know of any other songs of yours that were covered? Did you ever wish any particular band would cover a specific song of yours?I love it. It makes me feel good. Proud too. It's a great feeling to have people want to play your songs, especially when there are so many songs they could be singing. There's really no bad way to experience that kind of tribute. I've heard other bands cover my songs and the effect is always the same, a big fat smile across my face.- Do you feel like you helped some artists to launch their career through the influence you had on them, like being some kind of mentor (I'm thinking of Adrian Orange or Peter And The Wolf for instance)? Are there 'new' bands that have influenced you recently? What's currently on your stereo?I haven't heard that I was an influence on these artists. I'll have to check them out. I've heard Peter and the Wolf a couple times, I think he's from Austin, but I haven't heard Adrian Orange. At any rate, I dunno about this stuff. It's all reflective, this business of influence. Whose to say who does what to whom, you know? And if someone listens to me all the time maybe the thing they're getting out of it is something I stole from Peter Laughner or Loudon Wainwright III or Jackson C. Frank or D.Boon. My voice is there but a lot of times it's something specific that really does it for someone, and that might be the least original thing a person does, the thing that means the most to someone else. So, whose to say? I like the idea of people learning from other people's songs though, I certainly have and still do. There's always more to learn. I can't think of any recent influences, except maybe Bill Fay. I've been listening to his Time of the Last Persecution record a lot lately and he's someone I've only recently discovered.- Speaking of covers, how did you choose those appearing on the To Almost No One compilation? How come did you choose to cover only \"old\" artists? I suppose it was deliberate not to include any Bob Dylan or Leonard cohen covers? And is true a seconde volume is in the works? If so, can you give us a few details about it?In the liner notes I talk about choosing songwriters from the 60s and 70s who I thought were under-appreciated, for whatever reason, or simply obscure greats. Even someone like Kris Kristoffersen, a star, wasn't taken as seriously as he should be as a songwriter. Paul Siebel and David Blue were not well known. So, the somewhat obscure and under-appreciated heroes of song. That was the idea. Leonard Cohen, though not as successful as Kris Kristoffersen still gets more respect. Dylan and Neil Young have both popularity and respect. I wanted to pay tribute to songwriters from the 60's and 70's who were an influence on me and who I felt a kinship with because I've spent my life underground too. Very few people know about my music. For me it's fine, I wouldn't have it any other way. I think that obscurity and struggle are really great qualities for an artistic career of any kind. As a fan of these songwriters though, I wish more people knew how great they are. The whole project was a labor of love. I know there is something pretty ironic about someone no one knows covering a bunch of songwriters in order to spread the word about them. What good could I really do in that respect? Not much at all. So, ultimately, that wasn't the idea. I did it just because in my own little way I wanted to pay tribute to those songs and those songwriters, regardless of who was listening, just as they made their music originally, for the sake of the song. I am planning on doing another volume. I have all the records out and I'm trying to decide what song to do by each artist and eventually I'll have to cut artists to get it down to ten. My problem is I have too many I'd like to cover. Who knows when I'll get around to doing it, I thought it was going to happen last winter. Now another winter is coming. I'll try and do it then. We'll see.- How do you feel about being compared with Dylan and Cohen all the time? I mean it must be flattering, but isn't it becoming annoying at a certain stage?It's hard to read any music journalism. It's hardly writing at all these days, you know? There are so few real voices and what you get is all the easy, convenient, lazy associations people make when they haven't really bothered to do any work at all to engage themselves. I'd say it's flattering to be compared to Dylan and Cohen but it really isn't. It would be if the writers made a real argument or talked about how and why something resembled these other artists, but it's almost never an argument, it's a stand-in for a thought or an argument designed to take the place of work the writer has chosen not to do. People should demand more. These lazy writers should be asked to leave their posts. When so much of the rock journalism is so putrid and empty and boring, who would aspire to write it? All the good writers are taking their talent elsewhere and that's a shame because good writing about music is valuable, entertaining, and a great way to encourage people to think about art. I love good music journalism and I'm always hopeful that someone will go beyond the comparisons and actually dig into the music a bit, but life is short and they've got other things to do, I guess.- Do you see yourself making music til their age?I don't know. I plan to stop before I get bad and I hope I get old before I get bad.- What does have you keep on playing music and writing songs? Do you feel like there still is a lot of songs in you?There always seems to be something to write about, people to write about. Lives have a lot of layers to them and I feel like there is always another angle to approach these stories from, something I haven't done, or another voice or another side to one of these stories that needs to be explored. People are just dripping with songs. I look around and songs are all tangled up in people's hair or kinked up in people's backs, giving them poor posture, or all stuck in the make-up they put their faces behind. Songs are everywhere. I'm not worried about running out of songs.- Your early recordings are defined by a very lo-fi sound. How would you explain the fact that, like many artists who started this way (i'm thinking of Sparklehorse, Cat Power or Smog) your actual recordings tend to be more polished soundwise? Why do you keep the lo-fi productions on the \" low-key \" side of your releases (I'm thinking of that album you did with Dennis Callaci for instance)?In the beginning it was part aesthetic and part necessity. I could record everything in my house or in a warehouse space with a cassette four track or a two track reel to reel. There were limitations but I didn't have any other options. I also wanted raw sounds and I didn't have any good microphones or real recording gear so it forced improvisation in ways that were exciting to me, but there are definite drawbacks too. I didn't like to bounce tracks because I didn't want the fidelity to get too awful, so I had to be innovative about how I was going to get all the instrumentation I wanted onto a song without sacrificing too much. I'd have my friend Alex McManus play violin a few feet away from me and let his violin bleed onto my vocal microphone while I sang and played guitar, for example. It meant we had to try out different distances from the microphone before we got the right level of violin. We'd do the same thing with guitar and vocal, try to get away with one microphone, just to leave a track open in case we wanted something else on there. Drums only ever had one microphone and placing it in just the right spot was always a tedious process. Basically, you're mixing your song as you record it and that isn't always a good thing. Whatever momentum you have or energy you have that you want to capture in the moment can get ruined by the most basic technical problems which are alleviated as soon as you go from four tracks to eight, or eight to sixteen, etc.... More tracks means more microphones and less set-up time.I've tried to preserve what is advantageous to the music about the home recording set up. I always sing and play guitar at the same time, I don't overdub vocals. That way the spirit of the performance, warts and all, is there. I don't rehearse too much with the bands I put together once we're recording and I don't do a lot of takes of songs. I always try to do as much as possible live so we don't have a recording that sounds like it was put together from a bunch of separate pieces. Most of the time the band is live and only an acoustic piano or an extra guitar part is overdubbed. I also record in non-studio environments to make the sound more natural. Skeleton Blues was recorded in an abandoned building that used to be part of a train station. We set up in the big room and played like we were playing a show, with close microphone placement on amps, but everything still bled all over the place and I love the sound we ended up with, messy and raw but recorded with good equipment. Once the music leaves your head it's compromised, right? So, I'm always looking to do something different and make records that don't sound alike, even if it's going to be a compromised vision. I love the lo-fi sound when there's a reason for it, when it adds something. I don't think that lo-fi in and of itself is artistic. It's what people do with it. So, when I have a project like the one I did with Dennis Callaci where it makes sense to record in one room with one microphone because we don't know what we're going to do and spontaneity really is everything, I'm excited to do it that way. I think of recording as an instrument. It's just another tool of expression, but I don't think music should be categorized by how it's recorded. Lo-Fi is a way of recording, it isn't a sound. I use all kinds of recording methods all the time and for me it's about a search for a certain sound or a certain environment for a particular project I'm working on. I take it on a project by project basis. I wanted the Lousy Dance to have string arrangements on songs because I wanted those songs to have that treatment. But I go back and forth, my records haven't gone from terrifically lo-fi to super clean polished products. Even when recording in the studio for the Lousy Dance we put the chair where I was playing and singing outside the studio near some rattling windows for ambient room sounds so we wouldn't end up with a sterilized recording. I have no interest in having records sound like they could be played on the radio. When I record in a studio environment I'm always trying to figure out ways to make everything more natural and organic, less clean and perfect.Generally I have some definite ideas for the full length records and in order to concentrate on making the music, I don't want to over-burden myself with logistical problems that bog down the artistic process. When I recorded on a four track on my early records I actually did ten to twenty takes sometimes just because I had a violin too close or my guitar microphone was too close to my vocals or because the drums were bleeding too much into my vocal microphone, etc.... So, whatever spontaneity I hoped to capture was often minimized by having to do too many takes to get the sound right. Sometimes the music suffers because of the constraints and I think that recording with good equipment doesn't have to mean over-doing everything until it's perfect. On the contrary. Lost with the Lights On was recorded live in a studio in L.A. in a weekend. We had Jim White for two days. We recorded all the songs as a band, live, in two days and then did a day of little overdubs. Heaven's Gate or Songs for the New Year were recorded over a much longer period of time because of all the fuss of our recording method. I think they sound great but I can hear the fatigue in my voice and playing in parts and I know it's because it took too long to capture the song in the recording process.- You're about the same generation as those bands like Cat Power or Smog but unlike them you didn't use any alias to release your music. Any idea what difference does it make?To me, the joke of calling yourself a band when you are really a solo artist, got old very quickly. It's an ironic gesture, perhaps originally meant to subvert our cultural notions about what constitutes a musical group, but turned into something boring and condescending, which may be why some of these artists have started to go by their own names ten to fifteen years later. I think in some ways the alias was also a reaction to the 60's and 70's notions of singer-songwriters. Pretentious, overly sentimental, that's how we think of those performers as a culture. Calling yourself Bill Callahan might conjure up ideas of James Taylor or Gordon Lightfoot. Who wants that? So, I think the alias was developed as a way around that, and a way to say creepy, dark and really funny shit and get away with it without having to take direct credit (i.e. responsibility) for it either. For me it wasn't really a problem. I grew up listening to Neil Young and Bob Dylan and Tim Buckley and Nick Drake and Kris Kristoffersen and Lou Reed and I wanted to go by my own name. I probably would have sold more records all along if I had called myself Tornado or Castle or Satan's Bitch, but I chose the road less taken in the 90's and that has made all the difference, hi-ho!- I suppose one could also say that your sound has evolved a lot, regardless of the albums' production. Does it have anything to do with the fact you played with very diverse musicians or do they have strict guidelines when they're recording your songs?I think it helps everyone to play with different people. Recording with me is never going to be strict. I try to make it an open environment and there is a lot of freedom for everyone involved to be artistic, not just technicians. I make suggestions or try to articulate ideas to the various players and they take those ideas and use their expertise to come up with something far more interesting than what I originally had in mind. That's been my experience. I've worked with all kinds of musicians from various backgrounds and regardless of musical education and experience, every musician is there to contribute and transform mere sketches into something better, whether they are working for free or being paid or whatever. Once you get a bunch of creative people together the worst thing you can do is stick to your original plans. You have to allow all these great players to be part of the process if you want the best translation of your songs. And that's what it's going to be, a translation. It's my favorite part of the whole songwriting thing, the chance to turn over songs to musicians who like my music and see what we can do with the songs together. Of course sometimes there are directions that I don't like, that I object to aesthetically, and in those cases I control the process and take the song in another direction, but changing directions or telling musicians what you don't like is not the same as telling people what to do. That's another great thing about music, you can always perform the same song another way. In order for music to evolve, it has to embrace interpretation and strive for change. I definitely think that changing who you work with keeps the music fresh and leads to new ideas and that's why I keep making records. I'm not making much money at it so there wouldn't be a reason to do it if it weren't artistically satisfying.- Skeleton Blues is your third production (if I counted right) with The Fallen Men. Are they going to be your \"official\" back up band or will it be more like a Neil Young - Crazy Horse kind of relationship?Originally I had The Fallen Men as my Omaha band. Any recording that was going to be recorded here in town with Omaha musicians would be the Fallen Men. Oh, and Chris Deden had to be in the group. That was the criteria. It was mostly for 7\" records and the personnel changed from record to record except for Chris. When I decided to record a full length record with a group made up of guys I had played with around town, I wanted it to be Simon Joyner and the Fallen Men. The Omaha players are more working class and raw, a lot like the Crazy Horse distinction, so that fits. We played together for a long time and then we made the record. We developed the songs as a band and did a lot of bar gigs as the songs developed. After we recorded the record I felt like it was time to change the band to work toward a new sound so I started working with some other musicians and even though they're Omaha players, it's not going to be the Fallen Men. I don't want an official backing band, I prefer to keep working with different people. But that was a great band. I definitely miss playing with those guys. It's one of those things where when it gets too comfortable it's time to split, I guess. Maybe that's one of my many weaknesses but I like to keep the music changing and I don't like to be too comfortable or settled when I'm playing with other people.- Actually it's not innocent that I mention Neil Young since Skeleton Blues is probably your more electric guitar-oriented album. What made you want to plug the amps and bang those chords away? There is a predominance of 'epileptical' guitar solos, especialy on Open Window Blues and Medicine Blues...It was just what felt right for those songs. I wanted to put together a band and develop the songs organically as a group. In the past I had put together bands for a week of recording but I had never had a band that worked together for a year and played shows around town, changing the course of songs over a longer period of time before recording the songs. That was new for me. I was playing electric guitar instead of the acoustic and we had a lead guitarist and a pedal steel player who also played lead guitar. It led to some excursions into messy territory but it suited the songs, I think, so that's why I did it. It's one of those things where I'm thought of as a certain kind of songwriter but my records aren't all the same, they change, so when people are surprised I always want to ask if they are familiar with my other records. I'm all over the place. The songs are written in fits so they tend to work as a group and as I'm writing them and playing them I get an idea of what kind of approach they seem to require. The next batch of songs might take me in an entirely different direction. That's what I like about recording music. It really can be much more interesting than people tend to make it.- You said that you're not a very talented guitar player, would you say that the beauty of your songs comes from their simlicity?I dunno. The music is simple, I guess, most of the time. I like to keep it simple. A lot of times it's not a good idea to be both musically and lyrically challenging. Since I only know a handful of chords, there is a limit to how far I want to take things harmonically, but I vary structure and rhythm and whatever else is possible. The difference between Unchained Melody and Louie Louie is really almost no difference at all. There are so many different things you can do with a handful of chords, I've never run out of things I can do to make songs stand out from one another. Occasionally I have a song that I realize too late sounds too much like another song of mine from years ago but luckily there are very few people who will recognize the similarity so I get away with it.- I'd say that a song like Medicine Blues would be the kind of song a young Bob Dylan (sorry for the comaprison) would write nowadays if he wanted to express feelings about the state that America's in right now. Would you agree?Yes.- What makes this song so interesting is that it's not a protest song (which is probably 95% of songs dealing with the subject) but more like a social commentary. It feels like you avoid at all costs this genre of protest song, is that right? And if so, why is that?Protest songs are usually boring or at least not very enduring because they are about one thing and it's not a universal thing, it's a situational problem. It exists in a specific time and place. The same problems can be addressed from a more interesting perspective usually. I think Visions of Johanna slays Only a Pawn in Their Game but interestingly enough, A Hard Rain is A Gonna Fall absolutely destroys Hurricane which was written much later. Songs about an incident, however well dramatized, are limited. The expansive symbolic songs tackle much more, albeit from a more obtuse angle. There are more entrance points for the listener. The protest song is like reading a recipe off a box. It's on the nose, direct. It can be very effective at the time. Blowing in the Wind was very moving when it was written but it doesn't age well, whereas Mr. Tambourine Man never gets old, it knocks me out every time. Those words are put together to talk about MAN walking around NAKED in the UNIVERSE struggling for understanding. That's going to be applicable forever because we're flawed fucking creatures who will never figure it out, thumbs or no thumbs. I try to resist writing protest songs because they're lazy writing exercises. They're cheap, they preach to the choir and they don't take any risks. There is a way to work politically conscious lyrics into songs and I do that but I do it as an observation or an objection and not as a sermon.- Your recordings have been published on a lot of different labels, can you explain why is that? What led you to create your own imprint? I bankrupt labels. Everyone is excited to have me until they have to work with me. all my records have to come out on LP so it's hard for them to turn a profit. Basically I jump around because I almost never tour and it's expensive to put records out and never sell any because your artist doesn't tour. I try to leave before they get sick of me but it really is a problem. I used to tour all the time but I don't anymore. I'm about to tour in the U.K. and it's the first time in three years. I could probably record and perform music for a living but I think it would kill me if I were on the road all the time like a lot of my friends. I'd rather work another job and keep music as something I love to do but not something I have to do to make ends meet.- Your career got a nice boom thanks to John Peel, but did it help you get more famous in America?Not really. I was definitely more known in Europe than in America, thanks to Mr. Peel. He really forced me to keep making records. I might have stopped after The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll if he hadn't played it so much and gotten people interested in my music.- I read that you claim you'd be able to write some smash hits for other recording artists, like Weezer, so what's keeping you from doing so?It's too easy.- How much of yourself do you put into your lyrics? I mean, is there always a personal basis or are some songs totally made-up? More generally, how does your songwriting process occur?I guess there is always a personal element, nothing is totally made up. It can get you into trouble when elements are true but not everything. I write as if I were writing a book and hope people will not read into the songs in a specific way but will see how situations apply to a variety of situations. If I do write a song about a specific event I will try and write it from an unfamiliar perspective so it's more challenging and doesn't end up self-pitying. A lot of times I will write a whole song from the point of view of the least sympathetic character. It's harder to understand those motivations but they are the most interesting.- Do you give a lot of importance to your song titles? A friend of mine who never heard of you said that the lyrics were probably good just by having a look at the song titles.The titles are part of the song. Sometimes it's obvious what a song should be called and other times I have to give some thought. A song title is an opportunity to give more information, maybe something not in the song itself, so it can be important but not always.- I have the feeling that even though your lyrics are often very long (any particular reason why btw?) you tend to depict very specific situations with just a few sentences. For instance, on a song like Christine, it is really easy to picture everything else in the story that isn't sung about in the song. I often sense some kind of 'mute violence' in your songs through helplessness…That's the challenge in a song, to briefly say what needs to be said to convey all that needs to be known for the story to work. It requires more brevity than a short story. Even in a long song, you are still limited. A seven or eight minute song still only has a handful of words compared to an actual story so you have to use the time well and choose words carefully.- You've already written one book for children. How did that come about? Would you be ready to write a \" regular \" novel? If so, how would it be like?I wrote a little book for my son, Owen. It was part of a project someone was doing in a book making class at the university. They asked me if they could use a story for their project so I wrote this little story. It was fun. I don't know if I'll write longer fiction. I mess around but I keep writing songs and it takes up too much of my time. If I ever take a year off maybe I'll get around to finishing some stories. We'll see.- As I've never experienced a Simon Joyner gig, can you describe what it would be like? More on the introspective side or the rock'n'roll side? Or maybe a mixture? Should I expect some fine jokes between songs?It depends. Sometimes I play solo but other times I have small or large groups playing with me. The number of players changes the dynamics. There may be jokes, but not fine jokes.- Speaking of which, how come you tour so seldomly in Europe (and maybe in the US as well)?I only enjoy performing every night for about two weeks. After that it feels like work and I don't like it. So, I rarely do it. It's hard to make it financially worthwhile if you only want to be on the road for two weeks. I still do it occasionally (I'm about to leave on a little tour with Bright Eyes, in fact) but not so often. I love to perform but I don't like to punch the clock and that's what you have to do if you tour all the time. It's not artistic expression at that point, it's something else. Something that doesn't come easy to me.- What are your current projects?I have a series of duets I recorded with Fred Lonberg-Holm, Michael Krassner, Alex McManus and Dennis Callaci when I was artist in residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art. They aren't finished or edited but I hope to release a vinyl-only LP of songs from those collaborations sometime this year. I also plan to record the next volume of the singer-songwriter series, ten covers of songs from 60's and 70's singer-songwriters on five 7\" records. Those projects and writing songs for another album. I have about half of it written. Should be a busy year. "

  "title": "Wee Black Skelf Interview Simon Joyner, Part 1",
  "body": "Questions by Wolfman Ramirez & Nadine !McBay.''1. Is there a Simon Joyner manifesto? Can we be a part of it?''No manifesto. Yes, everyone is welcome.''2. You've worked with a lot with musicians who have their own projects; would you ever work more consciously collaboratively co-writing in the manner of Lennon & McCartney or Dylan & Cash?''I think I could collaborate in the manner of the Lennon-McCartney later relationship in which they wrote their own songs independent of the other and took it to their better half for little additions and/or approval or disapproval. Everyone needs a better half and both Lennon and McCartney benefitted from believing that the other was somehow better than they were. Even as ego-maniacs they respected each other and relied on the other for creative objectivity. I think they were like active editors. But the song was basically done before the other got his hands on it, at least that's my understanding. \"We Can Work It Out\" was essentially written but it became a better song when Lennon wrote the bridge for it, that kind of thing. I don't think I could write lyrics and music in total collaboration with another songwriter but I haven't tried. It would be an interesting challenge. Once I have the lyrics written though I can easily imagine collaborating on the music, like the Jefferies brothers in This Kind of Punishment or the Tall Dwarfs or any band with multiple songwriters and no official leader/dictator. I have actually spoken with Dennis Callaci (Refrigerator/Shrimper) about flying out to the California and making some music together. We're old friends and have always followed each other's music but never worked together. It's exciting. Hopefully we'll get to that soon. Separately I've also spoken to Ed Gray about working on a project like this. He's a fantastic songwriter who lives and works in Iowa City and has been making experimental singer-songwriter and noise/sound collage records for as long as I've been at it(Check out Ed's \"Fall Song\" LP--just reissued on vinyl for the first time).''3. After the success of the split single with the Mountain Goats would you consider making an EP with fellow Omaha performer Connor Oberst?''You mean a split record? Conor and I have played a lot of shows together and talked about recording together but haven't taken it further than that. I'm sure we will get around to it sometime before Conor is the official spokesperson for his generation. We'll see. I do have a split 7\" with Two Dollar Guitar out on the English label Misplaced Music. I like the split ep construct, all that fraternity and competition.''4. In comparison to your early work, your sound now has more depth. Do you find that your song writing style has developed differently because of this - that you have become a composer and arranger as well as writer? Does this added burden (or liberation!) make the craft of song-writing more difficult?''I think my songwriting has developed because of the peculiar way I have developed over the years, basically. Like anyone, I suppose. The songwriting transforms with the songwriter. The songs have required various approaches as the songwriting developed/changed. I don't really think of it in terms of getting better so much as in terms of change. There are things I did in the beginning that I really like but am not in a place to do now. I've changed. But I can look back and really appreciate certain things that I no longer do. I think there is a tendency to perceive any kind of evolution as a progression or a digression. In some cases people really do get measurably better or worse, but much of the time they just change in ways that gain or lose them fans who are or aren't willing to go wherever they are going. Some people say Lou Reed used to be good but now he sucks. They say the same about pretty much everybody. You rarely hear someone say they thought someone used to suck but they've gotten really good the longer they've been at it. Maybe they say that about that band Pulp. I don't know. At any rate, it gives me pause, and I'm suspicious of being led around by people on either side of the fence. There are people around Omaha who believe I peaked with my first cassette, Umbilical Chords. It is absurd, and thankfully it is a localized notion, but I think it is indicative of just how subjective all this business really is. If the first, say, Sebadoh record you heard was Bakesale, for example, or III, you might have put a mental straitjacket on the band because of the value that sound and those words had on you at that particular time in your life. You read the Stranger but you hate the Myth of Sissyphus. The first woman you ever love looks like Lee Miller and it's gotta be tall, sculpted, androgynous women or none at all for you, forever. Maybe it isn't important to bring this up. Usually I just smile and say \"thank you\" when someone tells me how good I used to be, or how good I am at the moment. As long as I don't get in the car for whatever fantasy road trip they're having in their head, everything is fine. It really is a joy to know that music has meaning for people, I hope I haven't implied otherwise. I don't think I'm making myself clear so I won't go on.I don't think about a song's arrangement while I'm writing the song. My approach is basically literary. I work on the lyrics and usually don't think about the music until they are written. Once written I determine what would compliment the lyrics or serve the story best. When I have the skeleton of the song I play it alot and make changes. When it is time to record the song I have ideas of what arrrangements would work well with the song but they are definitely not fixed, concrete ideas and they always develop over time after the song is written. The actual arrangement usually depends on who I've enlisted to perform with me. I am more interested in setting up a creative environment in which all the players bring ideas to the song. Most of the songs turn out much differently than I imagined they would when I brought them to the band. That's a good thing. It keeps it exciting for me. Usually the songs are already old to me by the time I record them so finding new possibilities in the songs is necessary, otherwise I would just want to leave those songs behind and start anew like John Darnielle is always doing. I have tapes he has sent me of new material (at different times) that never saw the light of day because he wrote so much that the songs felt old to him by the time he sat down to record. I completely understand that. If it's not up-to-date then it's hard to get excited about it. It's a sign of a truly living artist when they're constantly throwing terrific stuff away just because they didn't think of it at breakfast.''5. In the early 1990s charges were placed before the likes of Sebadoh and Pavement of a fear of success disguised as obscurantism; you yourself are notoriously reticent with regards to self-promotion and are wary of touring. Do you fear exposure in some psychological sense; that a degree of distance from your fans is needed to protect you in some way?''That's an interesting question but I don't really consider the paths Sebadoh or Pavement chose as indicating any fear of success. I mean they did all the things you do when you want to be a popular band, they played Lollapalooza and toured constantly, they had tons of t-shirts and posters and whatnot with their name on it, etc....They were bona fide success stories. I think the question is whether or not they were intentionally not becoming more successful, say on a Nirvana scale or something, and my gut feeling is that that wasn't an option for them really. But selling as many records as they were selling and touring as much as they did enabled them to quit their jobs and just make music for a living. I guess that is what we want for our artists but I dunno. Just as Nirvana-level success was not an option for those bands, Pavement-level success isn't really an option for me. This isn't to say that Pavement wasn't as good as bands that were as popular as Nirvana, they were better than most of the bands they mocked (\"stone temple pilots, they're elegant bachelors\") or that my music isn't as good or better than high performing independent bands like Pavement or Sebadoh or their recent equivalents. I just think that what I do won't appeal to as many people, for whatever reason--what I write about, how I sing, mood, etc....so avoiding success is a kind of non-issue for me. Still, I can honestly say that the absence of any pressure does afford me artistic freedom that I might not have in the same capacity if my music was popular on a much larger scale. Even if I scored a deal where I was given total artistic freedom to create whatever I wanted there might still be pressure in my head to maintain that success or please those new fans. The difference might be subtle but how would I keep the anticipations and expectations of all those thousands of suddenly interested listeners completely out of my mind when writing my song? So, it may appear that I am unsullied but perhaps I am just untested. That being said I really would not enjoy touring all the time and promoting my music constantly though I would like to have more money and more free time.I think it is important (at least for me) to maintain my personal life as a separate entity that feeds my art so that life and art are not one in the same. At times when I did tour a lot I became less and less interesting and more and more bored with music-making or songwriting at all. I realized finally that living an artist's life doesn't necessarily mean immersing oneself in art but rather, in life, and hopefully art will flow from that naturally. I hope this answer is as full of conflict as it seems. There isn't one answer to your question, unfortunately.

  "title": "Biography",
  "body": "By Piero ScaruffiSimon Joyner is a solitary songwriter born in New Orleans but based in Omaha (Nebraska). Born in New Orleans in 1971 from Alabama-native parents, he moved to the north still a child, but kept visiting the south frequently.* http://www.formspring.me/buytramadolhlc* http://blog.bitcomet.com/post/214825* http://ultram.groupsite.com/main/summary* http://www.formspring.me/wikifaqHis formative years as a songwriter and have done that yielded very personal collections like Umbilical Chords (One-Hour, 1992) and Iffy MC (Sing Eunuchs, 1993 - Unread, 2003). Most songs told sad stories of simple lives and were played by Joyner himself on guitar and little else. Room Temperature (One-Hour, 1993) is another album entirely played by Joyner (guitar and harmonica), still in the proud tradition of Woody Guthrie and early Bob Dylan. Folk Song For Sara, The Shortest Distance Between Two Points is a Straight Line, Ruby Slippers, Halleluja, Double Joe, [http://www.catlasertoy.com Cat Laser Toy], Ghetto Blaster, Godzilla, Vegetables, Seizure, Pseudonym Song, Scribble, Homebase, Petri-Dish, [Escort Booking], Leavenworth Cafe Blues, Grapefruit.The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll (Sing Eunuchs, 1994) was his first vinyl record and added electric guitar, drums (courtesy of friend Chris Deden) and piano: 747, Address, I Went to Our Lady of Perpetual Healing, Montgomery, August (Die She Must), Target, Josephine, Javelin, Appendix, Cole Porter, Joy Division. [Onsalenow] The same year Joyner also contributed Burn Rubber and Fluoride to the split single Why You All So Thief? (Sing Eunuchs, 1994,.Heaven's Gate (Sing Eunuchs, 1995 - Brinkman, 1996) perfected his sparse, delicate, dreamy style. The quantum leap forward really came from the arrangements, that finally left behind the folk standard and delved into atmospheric textures, thanks to a small chamber ensemble of organ, violin (Alex McManus??, a member of Lambchop and Vic Chesnutt's band), cello (Joyce Roper), banjo, mandolin, [http://desentupidorasanehidro.com.br desentupidora] , accordion (Bill Hoover) and percussions (Chris Deden). Promethius, Kerosene, Obituary, The Black Dog, Catherine, Three Well Aimed Arrows, You Don't Have to Love Me, Alabaster, Hollywood, Farewell to a Percival. Warm and sad, these songs bring back memories of Leonard Cohen.Songs for the New Year (Sing Eunuchs, 1997) is more of the same, the sound getting almost baroque. Joyner now enjoys conducting his little orchestra, that has enrolled Bob Garfield on lap steel and George Peek on bass. the seven-minute The Cowardly Traveller Pays His Toll, Oxygen, Parachute, New Year's Song, the seven-minute Two Friends take a Bow for the Record, the seven-minute When Will the Sun Rise Again?, Born of Longing, I Wrote a Song About the Oceans, the eight-minute Disappear From Here.Joyner established himself as a major voice in modern songwriting and arranging with the sprawling double-album Yesterday Tomorrow and In Between (Sing Eunuchs, 1998), one of the milestone recordings of that year, a glorious and highly personal summary of the aesthetic of Dylan, Young and Cohen.[Medela Symphony] For this impressive endeavour, Joyner surrounded himself with seasoned professionals such as Mike Krassner, Glen Kotche and Joseph Ferguson of Edith Frost's band, bassist Ryan Hembrey of Pinetop Seven, pianist Deanna Vargona of Lambchop, keyboardist Scott Tuma ([in Brussels]), and pianist Liz Conant, besides regulars Deden and McManus??. The ensemble excels at both stark piano ballads and sumptuous pop, while Joyner does not hesitate to wear his old folksinger clothes or lead the band into a country-rock number. A bit of Giant Sand's existential laziness keeps everything in check. Standouts include the ten-minute meditation Eight Verses, the 11-minute cinematic closer The Passenger and the pretty elegy Christine. Bring Down Goliath, Cold Outside Your Window, Mama, Eight Verses, Yesterday Tomorrow and In Between, Ballad in the Past, Sinner's Song, Morning is Weary, That Was You, Christine, Came a Yellow Bird, Amen, Don't Miss Your Lover, Goodbye, So Long, Farewell, Goodbye, The Passenger.The year was crowned by the single One For The Catholic Girls (Wurlitzer Jukebox, 1998), with the Fallen Men, and the The Christine EP (Secretly Canadian, 1998), that collected unreleased tracks dating from 1994 (John Train's Blues, Courting Mary, Everything's At Stake, Yellow Precious Letter ).The EP The Motorcycle Accident (Roomtone, 1999) marks a reunion with the Fallen Men (Chris Deden on organ, Lonnie Methe on violin and Brad Smith on percussions). Thoughts Of A Dog, Flowers On Her Birthday, I Ask Of You These Things, Sad Stories, Tom Paine #1/#2, There Was A Time - [writing essays].The Lousy Dance (Truckstop 1999) boasts a completely renewed line-up: Ken Vandermark on clarinet, Jessica Billey on violin, Fred Lonberg-Holm on cello, Jeb Bishop on trombone, Charles Kim on pedal steel, Ernst Long on flugelhorn and trumpet, Will Hendricks on piano, accordion and vibes join the core quartet of Chris Deden on percussion, Ryan Hembrey on bass, Glenn Kotche on percussions and Michael Krassner on electric guitar. Lambchop's chamber folk is now the most obvious reference, but Joyner's songs still have Leonard Cohen written all over them [http://asacompanhantessp.com.br acompanhantes sp]. And his soul-searching poetry has never been more romantic and erudite. The wonders of the instruments and the wonders of the words somehow find a magic balance that turns Joyner's songs into metaphysical journeys. The Lousy Dance, I Will Find You, the seven-minute Fool's Gold on Main St., the seven-minute Long Dark Night, It Will Never Be This Way Again, the six-minute When She Drops Her Veil, the six-minute The Rain Asked For A Holiday, the eight-minute John Train Blues.Hotel Lives (Truckstop, 2001) opens with the oneiric guitar timbres of Hotel Suite, one of Joyner's literate poems, only accidentally delivered as a song, a confession of loneliness and confusion uttered in a raucous Dylan-ian voice. Insomnia advances at Neil Young's solemn pace, with a bit of Billy Joel's lonely self-agonizing. Billy Joel comes to mind also in the upbeat and bouncing 7-minute ode to drinking My Life Is Sweet, with flourishes of spanish guitar. And Only Love Will Bring You Peace has the tender, naive, ecstatic feeling of Donovan's baroque lullabies. But Cohen's slow and deep crooning is just round the corner, lulling Blue Hammer, a nostalgic black hole that only radiates symbolic images [http://otimizacao-de-websites.com otimização de sites], Now We Must Face Each Other, a slow-motion cello-driven fanfare, or She Without Shelter, a waltz-paced yodeling whine. The slow, quiet, firm 7-minute rant of Your Old Haunts is one of his sweetest compositions ever. Joyner is clearly relishing the renewed sparseness of his sound. Depression is acute in The House, a funereal chant drowned in drones of strings. The nostalgy is no less naked on How I Regret That I've Done Wrong. Joyner has vastly increased the complexity of his compositions (You David Maria and Me shoots stark piano figures against a voodoo beat while strings murmur in the background, the 9-minute country-rocker Geraldine with saloon-piano [http://www.mtksistemas.com.br relogio de ponto] , and loud drumming) and their allegorical charge sometimes approaches that of Nick Cave's parables (especially with lines like \"only the guilty are ever really innocent\"). Compared with his latest albums, this one is a sparser, more subdued affair. The band has been completely revolutionized and, except for an occasional trumpet, cello or clarinet, the guitars rule again.single: Here Come The Balloons (Tongue Master, 2003).http://minniemousepartysupplies.comhttp://bachelorettepartysupplies.orgThree epic ballads loom over Lost With the Lights On (Jagjaguwar, 2004), Joyner's tenth album featuring Michael Krassner, Fred Lonberg-Holm, guitarist Eric Heywood, pianist Wil Hendricks and Dirty Three's drummer Jim White: the martial and slightly drunk Dreams of Saint Teresa, that perfects his fusion of Leonard Cohen's mood and Blonde on [payday cash] Blonde-era Dylan's pace; the romantic Evening Song to Sally, whose resigned lament is permeated with Latin overtones a`[inchirieri de masini] la Desire-era Dylan; and Blue, a slow waltz-like dirge that tests the depths of loneliness. The rest of the collection does not live up to the high standards of these three songs, but the lullaby Birds of Spring, the calm and plain Flying Dreams, the sad singalong Four Birds and even the electric blues romp of Forgotten Blues prove Joyner's eclectic and poetic talent.Beautiful Losers (Jagjaguwar, 2006) collects singles and compilation tracks from 1994-1999.Simon Joyner e` un cantautore solitario da Omaha, Nebraska. Il suo introverso talento e` sempre stato troppo timido per concedergli il relativo successo di un Joe Henry.I suoi primi dischi, all`inizio degli anni `90, sono confessioni per voce, chitarra e armonica nello stile di Guthrie e Dylan. Con gli anni si arricchiscono gli arrangiamenti fino a raggiungere il picco del periodo pre-Truckstop con il doppio Yesterday Tomorrow and In Between (Sing Eunuchs, 1998)Il passaggio alla Truckstop porta anche una nuova line-up: The Lousy Dance ([http://www.etil.com.br lampadas]) e` folk da camera cantato con piglio alla Cohen e arrangiato da una formazione che e` molto prossima al Boxhead Ensemble.Il recente Hotel Lives (***), prodotto da Krassner, e` forse da leggersi come un`opera di transizione. La musica e` piu` rarefatta, il taglio a= lla Cohen e` ancora molto forte e spiccano gli arrangiamenti classicheggianti di Lonberg-Holm. I brani sono a volte piu` complessi e si appoggiano parecchio sulle suggestioni alla Nick Cave delle liriche (ad esempio con versi come \"only the guilty are ever really innocent\", solo il colpevole puo` essere veramente innocente). * [http://www.ballbustings.com ballbusting] [http://www.wrestlings.org mixed wrestling] [http://www.penis-enlargement-natural.com penis enlargement][http://www.buyitcert.com/linux+.html linux+] [http://www.buyitcert.com/ceh.html ceh]  [http://www.buyitcert.com/chfi.html chfi] [http://www.buyitcert.com/ccna.html ccna] [http://voucherin.com free vouchers]"
